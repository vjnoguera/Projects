26335832,Asthma: definitions and pathophysiology.,Mims JW,"Mims, James W",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol. 2015 Sep;5 Suppl 1:S2-6. doi: 10.1002/alr.21609.,International forum of allergy & rhinology,2042-6984 (Electronic) 2042-6976 (Linking),United States,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common condition due to chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. Chronic lower airway inflammation is known to be more common in individuals that also have inflammatory disorders of the upper airway. The scientific understanding of asthma continues to improve and it is important for providers who treat upper or lower airway inflammation to be familiar with asthma's definition and pathophysiology. METHODS: Articles were selected based on literature reviews through PubMed and personal knowledge of the author. The search selection was not standardized. RESULTS: Asthma is a heterogenic condition that is underdiagnosed and undertreated despite that the skills needed to diagnose it are readily attainable and effective treatments are available. Providers need a working understanding of asthma in order to be proficient at managing their patients with chronic nasal or sinus inflammation. This article provides a primer focusing on the current conception asthma in terms of definition, possible etiologies, inflammatory profile, pathophysiology, subtypes, and overlapping conditions. CONCLUSION: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder arising from not fully understood heterogenic gene-environment interactions. It features variable airway obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Clinically, asthmatics exhibit recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1002/alr.21609 [doi],NLM,20426984

As technology in genome sequencing progressed, scientific efforts were made to explain and predict asthma's complexity and heterogeneity, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) quickly became the preferred study method. Several gene markers and loci associated with asthma susceptibility, atopic and childhood-onset asthma were identified during the last few decades. Markers near the ORMDL3/GSDMB genes were associated with childhood-onset asthma, interleukin (IL)33 and IL1RL1 SNPs were associated with atopic asthma, and the Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene was identified as protective against the risk to TH2-asthma. The latest efforts and advances in identifying and decoding asthma susceptibility are focused on epigenetics, heritable characteristics that affect gene expression without altering DNA sequence, with DNA methylation being the most described mechanism. Other less studied epigenetic mechanisms include histone modifications and alterations of miR expression. Recent findings suggest that the DNA methylation pattern is tissue and cell-specific. Several studies attempt to describe DNA methylation of different types of cells and tissues of asthmatic patients that regulate airway remodeling, phagocytosis, and other lung functions in asthma.

Treatment is often initiated based on the severity of symptoms, physical examination findings, and, for some patients, the FEV(1) or peak expiratory flow rates. Comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and laryngopharyngeal reflux, rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, sleep apnea, recurrent infections, smoking, and substance abuse should be addressed. Two treatment modalities are indicated only for individuals with allergic asthma: allergen-specific immunotherapy (commonly known as allergy shots), and biologic therapies that target type-2 (T2) inflammation. Allergen immunotherapy is effective in decreasing symptoms and medication use in select patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma. In addition, patients who receive allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis may have a decreased risk of developing asthma. Omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab are monoclonal antibodies that target T2 inflammation and are indicated for either moderate-to-severe or severe asthma. These have been well studied to improve asthma symptoms and have specific characteristics unique to each individual medication.

It affects more than 330 million of people worldwide throughout their educational and working lives, while exacerbations put a heavy cost/burden on productivity. Childhood asthma is characterized by a predominance of allergic sensitization and multimorbidity, while in adults polysensitization has been positively associated with asthma occurrence. Despite significant improvements in recent decades, asthma management remains challenging. Recently, a group of specialists suggested that the term ""asthma"" should be preferably used as a descriptive term for symptoms. Moreover, type 2 inflammation has emerged as a pivotal disease mechanism including overlapping endotypes of specific IgE production, while type 2-low asthma includes several disease endotypes. Optimal asthma control requires both appropriate pharmacological interventions, tailored to each patient, as well as trigger avoidance measures. Regular monitoring for maintenance of symptom control, preservation of lung function, and detection of treatment-related adverse effects are warranted.

Therapeutic intervention has focused on the appreciation that airway obstruction in asthma consists of bronchial smooth muscle spasm and variable degrees of airway inflammation characterized by edema, mucous secretion, and the influx of a variety of inflammatory cells.

It is important to assess these patients carefully in order to identify whether there are any correctable factors that may contribute to their poor control. It is critical to make a diagnosis of asthma and to exclude other airway diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and vocal cord dysfunction (""pseudo-asthma""). Poor adherence to therapy, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, is a common reason for a poor response. There may be unidentified exacerbating factors, including unrecognized allergens, occupational sensitizers, dietary additives, drugs, gastro-oesophageal reflux, upper airway disease, or other systemic diseases, that need to be identified and avoided or treated. Psychological factors may be important in some patients, but it is difficult to know whether these are causal or secondary to troublesome disease. Some patients have instability of their asthma, with resistant nocturnal asthma, premenstrual exacerbations or chaotic and unpredictable instability (brittle asthma). A few patients are completely resistant to corticosteroids, but more patients are relatively resistant and require relatively high doses of corticosteroids to control their symptoms (steroid-dependent). Some patients develop progressive loss of lung function, as in patients with COPD. Management of patients with difficult asthma should be supervised by a respiratory specialist and should involve careful assessment to confirm a diagnosis of asthma, identification and treatment of exacerbating factors, particularly allergens, and recording of peak expiratory flow patterns. A period of hospital admission may be the best way to assess and manage these patients. Treatment involves optimizing corticosteroids therapy, assessing additional controllers such as long-acting inhaled or subcutaneous beta2-agonists or subcutaneous, theophylline and antileukotrienes.

These cells release proinflammatory cytokine mediators that augment and regulate airway inflammation, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness responsible for the chronic asthma symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness. It is hypothesized, but unproven, that inflammatory effects can lead to irreversible structural and functional airway changes. Early intervention with anti-inflammatory agents mitigates inflammatory changes, reverses airway obstruction, and may possibly prevent progression of airway remodeling. Current asthma guidelines recommend that initial management should be based on pretreatment assessments of asthma severity as determined by measures of clinical and spirometric impairment in individual patients; subsequent adjustments of pharmacotherapy and avoidance recommendations should be performed at regular follow-up visits and guided by frequent assessments of asthma control. Physicians and providers should continually educate asthmatic patients about proper use of asthma controller medications, avoidance of asthma triggers, and self-management of asthma exacerbations.",Journal Article||Review,29.0,S1098-3597(08)80010-5 [pii]||10.1016/s1098-3597(08)80010-5 [doi],NLM,10983597

The two types of occupational asthma are classified on the basis of their temporal relationship to onset. Occupational asthma with latency reflects allergic occupational asthma and is a condition characterized by a preceding latent period of workplace exposure during which allergic sensitization to a material present at the work site occurs. It is characterized biochemically by immunologic alterations and physiologically by variable and work-related airflow limitation with the presence of both specific and nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness. In contrast, occupational asthma without latency is an asthmatic condition that develops suddenly and without a preceding latent period, as epitomized by the reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). RADS is distinguished physiologically by chronic, persistent nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness and usually occurs after a single brief high-level exposure to an irritant gas, vapor of fume; new information suggests that a more prolonged irritant exposure, in certain susceptible persons with a pre-existing allergic predisposition, can also lead to the initiation of new-onset asthma. The factors that may be influential in the pathogenesis of occupational asthma include: exposure characteristics, industrial factors, job attributes, geographic and climatic conditions, economic considerations and personal or host conditions, such as atopy and cigarette smoking. Preventive measures and opportunities for intervention are essential and must address plans for reducing or eliminating accidents and spills, as well as plans for engineering control methods and proper and effective local exhaust ventilation. Medical surveillance programs are the keystone for prevention and should identify persons who are at an increased risk for developing occupational asthma, as well as detecting asthma at an early stage when intervention options are likely to be successful. For sensitized workers, the best preventive option is completed removal from the work environment.",Journal Article||Review,32.0,0378-4274(95)03466-8 [pii]||10.1016/0378-4274(95)03466-8 [doi],NLM,03784274

This underlying chronic airway inflammation substantially contributes to airway hyper-responsiveness, air-flow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and disease chronicity. However, this underlying chronic airway inflammation has implications for the diagnosis, management, and potential prevention of the disease.

Such therapies have been investigated and approved in other indications, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic disease. Asthma's heterogeneous nature has made the discovery of similar therapies in asthma more difficult, although novel therapies (e.g. biologics) may have the potential to exhibit disease-modifying properties. To investigate the disease-modifying potential of a treatment, study design considerations can be made, including: appropriate end-point selection, length of trial, age of study population (key differences between adults/children in physiology, pathology and drug metabolism) and comorbidities in the patient population.

Exposures in the environment such as allergens and air pollutants have traditionally been linked to the risk of asthma and asthma outcomes. More recent literature has identified chronic psychosocial stress as an additional environmental exposure to consider in relation to asthma. Adverse childhood events (ACEs) and chronic and toxic stress have been associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic stress has also been shown to result in biological changes such as expression of immunologic genes, changes in expression of the beta-adrenergic (B2AR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-alpha) genes, cytokine regulation, and alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary axis and cortisol levels which all may affect asthma pathophysiology and therapeutic response among patients exposed to chronic stress. Recent research has revealed associations between ACEs and chronic and toxic stress and asthma risk in pre-conception to early childhood as well as morbidity and response to asthma treatments among pediatric and adult age groups. As some populations are more significantly impacted by asthma such as racial and ethnic minority groups, the influence of psychosocial stress has also been explored as a potential factor responsible for observed disparities in asthma prevalence and outcomes among these groups which also experience higher rates of psychosocial stress. Racial discrimination has specifically been shown to affect asthma-related outcomes among minority groups. Interventions to address the impact of chronic and toxic stress such as yoga and meditation have been shown to improve asthma outcome measures. Chronic and toxic stress is an important environmental exposure to further consider as we continue to explore the differences in underlying asthma pathophysiology leading to various disease phenotypes among patients and clinical/therapeutic response to interventions and treatments.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1007/s12016-019-08736-x [pii]||10.1007/s12016-019-08736-x [doi],NLM,15590267

Distinguishing phenotypes with regard to the severity or duration of the disease is essential. A phenotype covers the clinically relevant properties of the disease, but does not show the direct relationship to disease etiology and pathophysiology. Different pathogenetic mechanisms might cause similar asthma symptoms and might be operant in a certain phenotype. These putative mechanisms are addressed by the term 'endotype'. Classification of asthma based on endotypes provides advantages for epidemiological, genetic, and drug-related studies. A successful definition of endotypes should link key pathogenic mechanisms with the asthma phenotype. Thus, the identification of corresponding molecular biomarkers for individual pathogenic mechanism underlying phenotypes or subgroups within a phenotype is important. Whether newly defined asthma endotypes predict the individual course of asthma has to be validated in longitudinal studies. The accurate endotyping reflects natural history of asthma and should help to predict treatment response.

Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be.

Its definition continues to be controversial because there is no single genetic or environmental cause. Addressed from a descriptive point of view, the disease components include airway inflammation, symptoms, variable airflow limitation and chronic airflow limitation. The essentialist definition conveys the message that asthma is a separate disease entity, fails to identify a primary defining characteristic which separates it from other diseases and is long winded. These disadvantages are overcome by the nominalist definition of asthma in which the word 'asthma'refers to an abnormality of airway function, specifically to wide variations in airflow limitation over short periods of time. In patients with asthma the other components of airway disease need to be considered. These have separate nominalist definitions and especially include different types of bronchitis for airway inflammation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for chronic airflow limitation. What is present will vary between and within patients. The accurate diagnosis of asthma and of other components of disease all require objective measurements. Currently spirometry and airway responsiveness should be available to the general practitioner, who sees milder disease, and additional quantitative sputum cell counts in specialist practice, where moderate to severe disease is more prevalent.

In childhood, however, such characteristics as chronicity and irreversibility are debatable. Various clinical phenotypes with variable degrees of severity of persistence are found in children. Furthermore, many patients with a history of recurrent wheezing in early infancy do not develop asthma later in life. The prevalence of asthma, especially in its mild forms, has increased markedly in recent years. Although the trend has stabilized in Italy, it continues to rise in other Western countries. Our research has shown that increased cutaneous response to histamine determines a major prevalence of positive skin tests. The rise in clinical forms of the disease accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms is partly attributable to the dietary intake of food and beverages processed from environmentally engineered products. The features of the new forms of asthma demand accurate clinical and functional assessment. In addition to pulmonary function tests, determinations for eosinophils and inflammation markers in the blood and sputum, noninvasive methods have recently become available to assess airway inflammation. Among these, particularly useful studies include test for nitric oxide in exhaled air, along with tests for other markers of allergic inflammation and oxidative stress in the droplets of the exhaled air. Because in paediatric age, prolonged use of inhaled steroids increase the risk of growth impairment, asthma therapy should be guided by clinical criteria and examinations, rather than by rigid treatment guidelines.

Currently, the prevalence of childhood asthma is around 3-20% in different countries based on the report from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC). Asthma in childhood is predominantly an extrinsic asthma. In general, countries in the coastal, temperate, and subtropical zones have the highest prevalence of mite- and cockroach-sensitive asthma. Countries in the sub-arctic or semi-arid areas have a lower prevalence of childhood asthma, mostly associated with sensitization to pet dander, moulds, and pollens. Many genes have been linked to asthma in different ethnic populations. A global consensus for the management of asthma in adults and children >5 years of age has been made possible in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, where a step-wise management program using inhaled medication with and without oral anti-inflammatory drugs is recommended. The management of asthma in children <5 years of age remains inconclusive. Recent studies suggest that inherited susceptibility associated with risk factors from the prenatal and postnatal environment is likely to promote allergic sensitization and development of asthma. Consequently, early prevention of prenatal sensitization in utero and environmental control of early life exposure to various allergens may decrease the incidence of childhood asthma. In the management of moderate persistent asthma in infants and young children <5 years of age, airway resistance tests (FEV(1) or PEF) are not of significance, but assessment of respiratory rate and skin pulse oximeter measurements of arterial oxygen saturation are helpful. Moreover, recent advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics may provide better individualized care for early pharmacological prevention of childhood asthma via selective modulation of airway remodeling.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",97.0,412 [pii]||10.2165/00151829-200504010-00002 [doi],NLM,11763450

Circulating histamine levels are increased at night. 3. Hyperresponsiveness to AMP at night is increased compared with hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. However, most results of various studies point to nocturnal asthma's being an expression of more severe asthma: 1. Both AMP and propranolol responsiveness, indirect measures of airway hyperresponsiveness, are lower both at 4:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. in asthmatics with nocturnal asthma than those without nocturnal asthma. 2. Patients with nocturnal asthma have higher circulating numbers of eosinophils at both 4:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. than those without nocturnal asthma, and eosinophil survival is not different at these times. 3. Patients with nocturnal asthma have higher PGD2 levels in BAL both at 4:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. than those without nocturnal asthma, but show no significant difference between levels at these two times. 4. Two studies have shown no difference in BAL eosinophil numbers and activation parameters at night in nocturnal asthma. 5. Histamine levels in BAL fluid are comparable day and night in patients with and without nocturnal asthma. 6. Inflammatory mediators in BAL are higher in asthmatic patients than in normal subjects, but are not different between patients with and without nocturnal asthma. Thus, patients with nocturnal asthmatic symptoms show an overall increased burden of mediators released from mast cells and other inflammatory cells. In conclusion, we feel that the term ""nocturnal asthma"" is misleading, in that it does not describe a unique entity in certain patients with asthma. We prefer, in view of the previous arguments, to consider nocturnal asthma a mere expression of more severe asthma.

Guidelines recommend that clinicians identify a group at 'high probability' of asthma. High probability, however, is not numerically defined giving rise to uncertainty. The aim of this work was to build consensus on what constitutes a high probability of asthma in primary care. High probability was defined as the probability threshold at which there is enough information to make a firm diagnosis of asthma, and a subsequent negative test would not alter that opinion (assumed to be a false negative). DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: A consensus workshop using modified nominal group technique was held during an international respiratory conference. PARTICIPANTS: International conference attendees eligible if they had knowledge/experience of working in primary care, respiratory medicine and spoke English. METHODS: Participants took part in facilitated discussions and voted over three rounds on what constituted a high probability of asthma diagnosis. The workshop was audio-recorded, transcribed and qualitatively analysed. RESULTS: Based on final votes, the mean value for a high probability of asthma in primary care was 75% (SD 7.6), representing a perceived trade-off between limiting the number of false positives (more likely if a lower threshold was used) and pragmatism on the basis that first-line preventive therapies (ie, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids) are relatively low risk. The need to review response to treatment was strongly emphasised for detecting non-responders and reviewing the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: A consensus probability of 75% was the threshold at which the primary care participants in this workshop felt confident to establish the diagnosis of asthma, albeit with the caveat that a review of treatment response was essential. Contextual factors, including availability and timing of tests and the ease with which patients could be reviewed, influenced participants' decision making.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",,bmjopen-2019-034559 [pii]||10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034559 [doi],NLM,20446055

Over the last 20-30 years, there has been increasing appreciation that ""severe asthma"" encompasses multiple different subgroups or phenotypes, each with differing presentations. Using clinical phenotyping, in combination with rapidly advancing molecular tools and targeted monoclonal antibodies (human knockouts), the understanding of these phenotypes, and our ability to treat them, have greatly advanced. Type-2 (T2)-high and -low severe asthmas are now easily identified. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil counts can be routinely employed in clinical settings to identify these phenotypes and predict responses to specific therapies, meeting the initial goals of precision medicine. Integration of molecular signals, biomarkers, and clinical responses to targeted therapies has enabled identification of critical molecular pathways and, in certain phenotypes, advanced them to near-endotype status. Despite these advances, little guidance is available to determine which class of biologic is appropriate for a given patient, and current ""breakthrough"" therapies remain expensive and even inaccessible to many patients. Many of the most severe asthmas, with and without T2-biomarker elevations, remain poorly understood and treated. Nevertheless, conceptual understanding of ""the severe asthmas"" has evolved dramatically in a mere 25 years, leading to dramatic improvements in the lives of many.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",,10.1164/rccm.202009-3631CI [doi],NLM,15354970

Several guidelines and/or consensus documents are available to support medical decisions on pediatric asthma. Although there is no doubt that the use of common systematic approaches for management can considerably improve outcomes, dissemination and implementation of these are still major challenges. Consequently, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has decided to propose an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma. The purpose of this document is to highlight the key messages that are common to many of the existing guidelines, while critically reviewing and commenting on any differences, thus providing a concise reference. The principles of pediatric asthma management are generally accepted. Overall, the treatment goal is disease control. To achieve this, patients and their parents should be educated to optimally manage the disease, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Identification and avoidance of triggers is also of significant importance. Assessment and monitoring should be performed regularly to re-evaluate and fine-tune treatment. Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. The optimal use of medication can, in most cases, help patients control symptoms and reduce the risk for future morbidity. The management of exacerbations is a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment.

Recent studies have suggested that the recognition of subphenotypes of asthma based on the pattern of airway inflammation may be particularly useful in increasing our understanding of the disease. The present review discusses the important literature in this field, placing current work in its historical context. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of noninvasive markers of airway inflammation has suggested the presence of four distinct phenotypes: eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed inflammatory and paucigranulocytic asthma. Recent studies suggest that these subgroups may differ in their aetiology, immunopathology and response to treatment. Several studies have focused on refractory asthma as a distinct phenotype with evidence of a more distal pattern of airway inflammation and of upregulation of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha axis. Finally, novel treatment approaches targeted at specific patterns of airway inflammation are emerging, making an appreciation of subphenotypes particularly relevant.

However, little research in this area has examined conceptual models of asthma using embodiment theory, which suggests that caregivers' and children's experiences of the physical body shape their perspectives and consequent management strategies. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how two embodied processes of symptom perception-detection and interpretation-may influence caregiver or patient conceptions of asthma. METHODS: We interviewed 41 caregivers of children with asthma in Gainesville, Florida, and St. Louis, Missouri, and conducted ethnographic visits or virtual interviews with 19 children with asthma aged 6-16. RESULTS: Four aspects of asthma's embodied experience shaped conceptual models via processes of detection and interpretation: 1) symptoms are experienced in the context of other bodily processes; 2) acute symptoms and exacerbations are more salient than their absence; 3) the embodied experience of asthma is one of integrated physiological and emotional processes; and 4) caregivers and children acquire embodied practices of perceiving symptoms that produce embodied knowledge. CONCLUSION: Participant narratives suggest that embodied experiences of asthma shape caregivers' and children's understandings of asthma in ways that differ from the biomedical model. We argue that a focus on embodied experiences may provide important ground for mutual understanding and communication between providers and caregivers and/or patients.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,S0277-9536(22)00009-0 [pii]||10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114706 [doi],NLM,18735347

The numerous possible causes of occupational asthma can be classified in high molecular weight compounds of biologic origin and low molecular weight chemicals. Occupational asthma can also follow from airway irritation, either after an acute inhalational injury, or after chronic or repeated peak exposures to irritants. From a medicolegal point of view, occupational asthma presents problems with regard to establishing a causal relationship between work and asthma and in relation to the generally inadequate compensation of victims.

There are huge differences in the prevalence of childhood asthma across countries and continents, and there is no doubt that the prevalence of asthma was strongly increasing during the past decades worldwide. Asthma, as a complex disease, has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to life style and environmental factors. Environmental factors are likely to be important in explaining the regional differences and the overall increasing trend towards asthma's prevalence. Among the environmental conditions, indoor factors are of particular interest because people spend more than 80% of their time indoors globally. Increasing prices for oil, gas and other sources of primary energy will further lead to better insulation of homes, and ultimately to reduced energy costs. This will decrease air exchange rates and will lower the dilution of indoor air mass with ambient air. Indoor air quality and potential health effects will therefore be an area for future research and for gaining a better understanding of asthma epidemics. This strategic review will summarize the current knowledge of the effects of a broad spectrum of indoor factors on the development of asthma in childhood in Western countries based on epidemiological studies. In conclusion, several epidemiological studies point out, that indoor factors might cause asthma in childhood. Stronger and more consistent findings are seen when exposure to these indoor factors is assessed by surrogates for the source of the actual toxicants. Measurement-based exposure assessments for several indoor factors are less common than using surrogates of the exposure. These studies, however, mainly showed heterogeneous results. The most consistent finding for an induction of asthma in childhood is related to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, to living in homes close to busy roads, and in damp homes where are visible moulds at home. The causing agents of the increased risk of living in damp homes remained uncertain and needs clarification. Exposure to pet-derived allergens and house dust mites are very commonly investigated and thought to be related to asthma onset. The epidemiological evidence is not sufficient to recommend avoidance measures against pet and dust mites as preventive activities against allergies. More research is also needed to clarify the potential risk for exposure to volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds due to renovation activities, phthalates and chlorine chemicals due to cleaning.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",,S1438-4639(10)00112-4 [pii]||10.1016/j.ijheh.2010.08.009 [doi],NLM,1618131X

Hypnosis is also possibly efficacious for decreasing airway obstruction and stabilizing airway hyper-responsiveness in some individuals, but there is insufficient evidence that hypnosis affects asthma's inflammatory process. Promising research needs to be replicated with larger samples and better designs with careful attention paid to the types of hypnotic suggestions given.

Nevertheless, significant gaps remain in our understanding of this disease. Important new treatment issues affect childhood (the usual time of asthma onset), and researchers have recently described increases in asthma incidence in children. Yet, most clinical studies have been performed with adults, and our knowledge about major determinants of childhood asthma remains incomplete. Major challenges in pediatric asthma include methods of easily assessing lung function and noninvasive methods of assessing asthma's inflammatory nature. Research that addresses the mechanisms responsible for disease onset is also critical to decrease the prevalence of asthma.

This inflammation results in airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchial muscle spasm, mucous gland hypersecretion and mucosal edema, which combine to create symptoms such as cough, wheezing and respiratory distress. Because the inflammatory process is highly variable, asthma is a disorder with many possible presentations. It may therefore proceed for years without clinical recognition, and may challenge the most astute diagnostician. It is important for otolaryngologists to be able to suspect, diagnose and treat asthma. This is so because asthma is a common disease in the otolaryngologic patient population, both as one of the options in the differential diagnosis of respiratory complaints, and as a comorbid condition which may complicate the treatment of other medical or surgical problems. Furthermore, both the understanding of asthma's pathophysiology, and its optimum treatment methods have undergone radical changes during the past decade. This three-part discussion reviews our modern understanding of asthma, and proposes diagnosis and treatment guidelines which can assist otolaryngologists in effectively managing their asthmatic patients. Part one summarizes current information on the pathophysiology and increasing prevalence of asthma, its clinical variability, the assessment of asthma sensitivity, and methods for diagnosis of asthma.

DATA SOURCES: ISAAC was conceived to maximize the value of epidemiologic studies on asthma and allergic diseases, establishing a standardized method (self-applicable written questionnaire and/or video questionnaire) capable to facilitate the international collaboration. Designed to be carried out in three successive and dependent phases, the ISAAC gathered a casuistic hitherto unimaginable in the world and in Brazil. This review included data gathered from ISAAC official Brazilian centers and others who used this method. DATA SYNTHESIS: At the end of the first phase, it has been documented that the prevalence of asthma among Brazilian schoolchildren was the eighth among all centers participating all over the world. Few centers participated in the second phase and investigated possible etiological factors, especially those suggested by the first phase, and brought forth many conjectures. The third phase, repeated seven years later, assessed the evolutionary trend of asthma and allergic diseases prevalence in centers that participated simultaneously in phases I and III and in other centers not involved in phase I. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, the ISAAC study showed that asthma is a disease of high prevalence and impact in children and adolescents and should be seen as a Public Health problem.

This study explored the comparative implementation experiences and future treatment preferences of mild asthma patients who had experienced these two treatment regimens. SETTING: A subgroup of adults randomised to maintenance ICS or as-needed ICS-formoterol in a multinational, 52-week open-label randomised controlled trial (NovelSTART) in mild asthma patients were interviewed to explore their motivations for treatment use during the study and their preferences for future treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 74 participants (Maintenance group: n=39, As-needed group n=35, mean age 38 (range 19-69)) and thematically analysed from transcribed audiorecordings. RESULTS: Emergent themes from analysis comprised: 'How much my asthma affects me' (how their asthma's impact affected their self-management motivation); 'What I know about asthma' (limited knowledge impeded appropriate self-management decision making); 'How much effort this treatment regimen involves for me' (treatment complexity and/or difficulty establishing a medication routine impeded implementation, particularly in the Maintenance group); and 'My beliefs about the benefits and risks of this treatment' (patients who considered their treatment as ineffective, eg, limited difference in symptoms relative to salbutamol (both groups) or slower onset of relief (As-needed group) had poor motivation to use the treatment). Due to the simplicity of the as-needed combination strategy, this was the preferred future regimen, even by patients who had not yet tried it. CONCLUSIONS: Key patient perspectives on the implementation of preventer treatments for mild asthma included factors relating to perceived asthma burden, disease knowledge, treatment complexity and treatment usefulness or safety. The as-needed budesonide-formoterol regimen was preferred to maintenance ICS treatment in mild asthma though patient education is urgently needed to address implementation motivation.

A detailed history is of great importance in raising suspicion of occupational asthma, but studies have shown that even detailed histories obtained by experienced specialists can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the presence or absence of occupational asthma. Consequently, objective measurements should be performed to establish the diagnosis of occupational asthma whenever possible. If the patient is still working in the workplace, work-related changes in spirometry or peak flow measurements can confirm the diagnosis. For occupational asthma from some airborne sensitizers, immediate-type skin testing or in vitro tests for specific IgE may establish sensitization. However, there is evidence that for some isocyanates, in vitro tests for specific IgG serum antibody levels correlate better with documented bronchospasm from isocyanate exposure, even though the IgG antibody is not thought to be pathogenic. Controlled, specific inhalation tests may be valuable, but they should be performed only under experienced medical supervision. Intervention should be focused on reducing or avoiding harmful workplace exposures so that permanent lung impairment and need for chronic medical treatment are avoided. Assessment of permanent impairment/disability from occupational asthma optimally should be determined 2 years after the removal from occupational exposure, when improvement has been shown to plateau and the patient will likely have reached maximal medical improvement.",Journal Article||Review,19.0,,NLM,10885412

We find that during activation, the beta(2)AR is modified by S-nitrosylation, which is essential for both classic desensitization by PKA as well as desensitization of NO-based signaling that mediates bronchorelaxation. Strikingly, S-nitrosylation alone can drive beta(2)AR internalization in the absence of traditional agonist. Mutant beta(2)AR refractory to S-nitrosylation (Cys265Ser) exhibits reduced desensitization and internalization, thereby amplifying NO-based signaling, and mice with Cys265Ser mutation are resistant to bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and the development of asthma. S-nitrosylation is thus a central mechanism in beta(2)AR signaling that may be operative widely among GPCRs and targeted for therapeutic gain.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,S1097-2765(22)00651-7 [pii]||10.1016/j.molcel.2022.06.033 [doi],NLM,10974164

This prospective and cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study assessed school/work and activity impairment in children and adolescents with allergic asthma and their caregivers and allergen immunotherapy (AIT) effects. Included patients were schooled children and adolescents (5 to 17 years) with allergic asthma due to house dust mites (HDM). Impairment of school/work (i.e., absenteeism and presenteeism) and activity was measured in patients and their caregivers using the Work Productivity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment Questions: Allergy Specific (WPAI + CIQ:AS). HDM allergic patients with school impairment received subcutaneous AIT with a MicroCrystalline Tyrosine-associated allergoid. WPAI + CIQ:AS and effectiveness variables were compared between baseline and 1-year post-AIT. Of the 113 patients included, 59 (52.2%) and 51 (45.1%) showed school and activity impairment, respectively, missing a mean (SD) of 37.6 (24.4) % and 42.6 (25.6) % of school and activity time, respectively. Twenty-six (23%) caregivers reported activity impairment and, of the 79 (69.9%) employed, 30 (38%) reported work impairment. Of the 65 patients with school/activities impairment, 41 (63.1%) received AIT, of which 21 (51.2%) completed 1 year of treatment. Effectiveness variables and WPAI + CIQ:AS significantly improved: Mean (SD) school impairment decreased from 39.7 (26.7) to 2.1 (7.1) % (p < 0.001) and activity impairment from 46.2 (34.6) to 1.4 (3.6) % (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Allergic asthma due to HDMs results in school/work and activity impairment in children and adolescents and their caregivers. One year of AIT provided clinical benefits and reduced school and activity impairment. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Allergic asthma impairs children's school performance and daily activities. * Allergen immunotherapy modifies allergic disease course and ameliorates its symptoms. WHAT IS NEW: * Asthma symptoms due to allergy to house dust mites impair children's school attendance and productivity and daily activity and their caregivers' work performance and daily lives. * Allergen immunotherapy with a house dust mite MicroCrystalline Tyrosine (MCT)-associated allergoid seems to provide clinical benefits, associated with decreased school and activity impairment, supporting it as an effective treatment option.",Journal Article||Multicenter Study||Observational Study,,10.1007/s00431-021-04346-y [pii]||4346 [pii]||10.1007/s00431-021-04346-y [doi],NLM,14321076

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether partly and uncontrolled asthmas are associated with increased costs for asthma-related healthcare utilization compared to well-controlled asthma and to determine whether these associations differed across racial groups. METHODS: We classified respondents from the Asthma Insights and Management survey into those with well-, partly and uncontrolled asthma and compared utilization of healthcare services and costs among these groups, as well as between whites and non-whites. RESULTS: Respondents categorized as having asthma that was not well-controlled reported lower income levels, higher rates of unemployment and more trouble paying for healthcare; similar results were found in analyses stratified by race. Patients whose asthma was partly or uncontrolled had greater use of asthma-related medications and medical services compared to patients whose asthma was well-controlled. Total unadjusted and adjusted costs were greater in patients whose asthma was classified as partly and uncontrolled. Similar results were found in analyses stratified on race. Across all levels of asthma control, non-whites had higher rates of utilization of emergency rooms and urgent care facilities and had greater rates of hospitalizations compared to whites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that patients with asthma that is not well-controlled utilized more healthcare resources and had greater medical costs, despite lacking of health insurance which may suggest less access to care.","Comparative Study||Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,10.3109/02770903.2013.795589 [doi],NLM,15324303

Inhaled beta 2 agonists should be used by patients with mild asthma during brief and limited symptomatic episodes. Anti-inflammatory agents, such as inhaled corticosteroids or cromolyn, should be added for moderate degrees of asthma. If symptoms persist, a long-acting bronchodilator, such as an oral beta agonist or oral theophylline, may be added in the evening. A short course of oral steroids may also be prescribed as needed.

Several articles have shown that EDN levels are higher in patients with asthma than in controls, and EDN levels are correlated with the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)%) in patients with asthma. Their results were inconclusive. Methods: A comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to assess EDN levels between patients with asthma and controls, and the correlations between EDN and FEV(1)% in the patients with asthma. Fourteen relevant articles were identified from electronic data bases. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference of EDN levels between the patients with asthma and controls, and pooled coefficient (r) values with 95% CI for the correlations between EDN and FEV(1)%, respectively, were calculated. Results: A total of 14 articles were selected. Among the included reports, six articles related to the difference and eight essays on the correlation. Pooled effect size showed that EDN levels were higher in patients with asthma than in controls (SMD 2.85 [95% CI, 1.92-3.78]). Furthermore, the pooled effect size showed that EDN levels were negatively correlated with FEV(1)% in patients with asthma (r -0.21 [95% CI, -0.28 to -0.14]). Conclusion: EDN levels increased in the patients with asthma compared with in the controls. They were correlated with FEV(1)% in the patients with asthma, which indicated that EDN could be a reliable marker to monitor asthma's therapeutic effects.",Journal Article||Meta-Analysis,,10.2500/aap.2023.44.230016 [doi],NLM,15396304

Blood samples from case-control studies (study 1: 348 asthmas and 39 normal controls and validation study 2: 411 asthmas and 87 normal controls) were enrolled. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis method was performed to quantify the abundance of 21 TLR signatures. Gene ontology analysis and pathway function analysis were conducted for functional analysis, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. The area under the curve (AUC) value was used to assess the diagnostic capacity. In this study, TLR2/TLR3/TLR4 pathway, MyD88-dependent/independent TLR pathway, positive regulation of TLR4 pathway, and TLR binding signatures were significantly higher in asthma. Functional analysis showed that biological processes and pathways were still involved in TLR cascades and TLR signaling pathway. Eleven hub TLR-related genes were identified, and further validation demonstrated that the combination of TLR-related genes was a good diagnostic biomarker for asthma (AUC = 0.8). Our study provided more insight into the underlying immune mechanism of how TLR signatures affected asthma. The use of the easy-to-apply TLR-related genes might represent a promising blood-based biomarker for early detection of asthma.",Journal Article,,10.1089/dna.2020.5543 [doi],NLM,15577430

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine and compare the psychometric properties of the A-IQOLS and QOLS, including their sensitivities to differences and change in asthma status. METHODS: In a test-retest design (3- to 5-week interval) adults with persistent asthma underwent spirometry and were administered the A-IQOLS, other asthma outcome measures (Asthma Control Test, Asthma Symptom Utility Index, and the Marks and Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaires), and the QOLS. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 147) mean age was 49 years, 76% were white, 12% were Hispanic, and 65% were female. A-IQOLS and QOLS scores were significantly correlated with other asthma outcomes scores, except FEV(1), but shared relatively low common variance with these measures. A-IQOLS but not QOLS score changes were significantly correlated with changes in asthma outcomes. An A-IQOLS standard error of measurement of 0.27 implies that a within-person score change of +/-0.73 or greater constitutes a true change. The QOLS standard error of measurement was 0.43. CONCLUSIONS: A-IQOLS provides a reliable, valid, and unique assessment of the patient-perceived negative effect of asthma on QoL that is suitable for use in asthma clinical research and potentially in clinical care. Further studies are needed in diverse patient populations. QOLS, a measure of current QoL, is less sensitive to disease status changes but might be useful in characterizing study populations, in treatment adherence research, and as a clinical and research tool in patients with multiple, severe, and/or life-limiting chronic conditions.","Clinical Trial||Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,S0091-6749(17)30887-4 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2017.02.047 [doi],NLM,10976825

It affects all age groups, mainly youth. Its management aims to prevent exacerbations and ensure normal daily-life activity. Current international recommendations attach particular importance to the therapeutic education to improve asthma control and reduce emergency room visits. AIM: To assess the impact of online therapeutic education for youth asthmatics initiated in the emergency department on the level of asthma's control. METHODS: Descriptive-evaluative study conducted over six months including asthmatics aged 14 to 35 years old living in Ariana. Asthma control was evaluated according to the 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations with a reassessment at three months after online therapeutic education. RESULTS: N=75; 18% of patients were adolescents, sex-ratio = 0.56. University education was noted in 73% of cases and high socioeconomic status in 48% of subjects. 55% of participants had no basic knowledge of the asthma's pathophysiology. Moderate classification of the last exacerbation was noted in 71% of patients and humidity was the most common exacerbation trigger (76%). A significant improvement in asthma control was observed after therapeutic education (p <0.001) with a positive correlation with female gender (p=0.048), basic knowledge of asthma's pathophysiology (p=0.001) and mild classification of the last exacerbation (p=0.039). Male gender and humidity as exacerbation trigger were independent factors negatively influencing control outcome after therapeutic education. CONCLUSION: The emergency department is the referral unit of the management of asthmatics with acute events.

The prevalence of severe refractory asthma is not known with any precision, in view of the lack of a consensus definition. Few studies have examined the role of allergic factors. From a pathophysiologic perspective, genetic factors are probably responsible for greater severity, and allergic response plays an important role in some severe asthma phenotypes.

METHODS: Health promoters from El Puente in North Brooklyn, New York City, surveyed 3015 people in 946 households, asking standard asthma prevalence questions. RESULTS: Some 46% of households identified themselves as Dominican, 42% as Puerto Rican, 6% as other Latino, and 6% as other. Reported asthma period prevalence was 5.3% (93 of 1749) among Dominicans and other Latinos, compared with 13.2% (147 of 1115) among Puerto Ricans (odds ratio = 0.37; 95% confidence interval = 0.28, 0.49), a difference not explained by location (cluster or building), household size, use of home remedies, educational attainment, or country where education was completed. Differences were least detectable among 13- to 24-year-olds of both sexes and sharpest among women aged 45 years and older and girls from birth to 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: Further research on gene-environment interactions is needed among Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, but asthma's associations with low income and unhealthy environment, which more recent immigrants seem better able to withstand, should not be overlooked.","Comparative Study||Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,10.2105/ajph.90.6.929 [doi],NLM,00900036

The ITA can fail due to causes attributable to the patient, vaccine-inherent causes and/or factors related to the allergic disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the main causes of specific immunotherapy with allergens' failure in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study 126 records of patients with allergic asthma treated in the extern consultation service of the clinical immunology and allergy department of the CMN 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, were reviewed from January 1996 to December 2001. RESULTS: It was found that specific immunotherapy with allergens, failed in 32 (23%) patients. Main causes of failure were: 1) withdrawal in the vaccine application in 19 (59%) patients; 2) high serum levels of IgE. The co-morbidities that contribute to poor responses to the treatment were: obesity, gastroesofageal reflux and chronic rhynosinusitis.

The present study aimed to (1) explore adolescents' and caregivers' perceptions about asthma and asthma management and (2) examine congruence and dissimilarities within the adolescent-caregiver dyads. METHODS: Data collection was conducted separately for adolescents and caregivers using a focus group approach for the adolescents and telephone interviews for parental data collection. In total, dyadic data from n = 15 adolescent patients with asthma (aged 11-17 years, M = 14.9) and their mothers (aged 37-55 years, M = 46.3) were considered in the study. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed in a dyad-focused multistep qualitative content analysis procedure using the software. RESULTS: The results demonstrated high complexity in the perceptions among adolescents and mothers and reflected 113 specific themes that could be assigned to four main topics: asthma beliefs, representations of asthma treatment, perceptions about individual asthma management and perceptions about family asthma management. Dyadic analyses revealed congruence in the adolescent-caregiver dyads in most of the themes. However, we also found issues where divergent perceptions became evident including, for example, perceptions of asthma's general impact on adolescents' life or the question of who takes the main responsibility in asthma management. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' and caregivers' perceptions were found to reflect a great variety of beliefs regarding the adolescents' illness and illness-related behaviour on both the individual and the family level. The study adds to the illness perceptions literature by providing a systemic perspective that was rather rarely presented in prior research.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,10.1111/cch.12277 [doi],NLM,13652214

Bronchial asthma is now understood as an inflammatory disease of the airways which show characteristic pathologic features: infiltration of the airways with inflammatory cells (especially eosinophils and T lymphocytes), epithelial shedding, airway smooth muscle thickening, subepithelial fibrosis, mucus gland and goblet cell hyperplasia with hypersecretion of mucus. Classification based on etiology unfortunately has not the immediate influence on the treatment of patients with asthma and therefore classification based on severity of disease was approved by several international consensus reports, which divide asthma into four groups: intermittent asthma, and mild, moderate and severe persistent asthma. From the second step (mild persistent asthma) antiinflammatory drugs are considered as the first line therapy, of which inhaled glucocorticosteroids are both in adults and children the most effective controllers. There is increasing evidence that early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids can prevent development of irreversible airway obstruction. Most patients with asthma can get their disease under optimal control and reach the goals of treatment by long-term management in the stepwise approach. Self-monitoring and regular follow-up with ongoing education is one of the most important part of long-term management program.",English Abstract||Journal Article||Review,26.0,,NLM,00087335

Despite asthma's high prevalence and morbidity among adolescents, this association has not been examined in adolescents. We tested the association of EIW and other asthma symptoms to asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations in urban adolescents with probable asthma. We hypothesized that EIW would be associated with urgent care. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study 30,467 high school students (mean age = 16.0) from 49 NYC schools completed two brief validated measures, one assessing probable asthma and the other the frequency of six asthma symptoms over the past year. Adolescents also reported if in the past year they had an asthma-related ED visit or hospitalization. Analyses presented here included students with probable asthma (n = 9149). Using logistic regression, we modeled each asthma symptom as a function of ED visits and hospitalizations adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity and asthma severity. Multivariable models included all symptoms to account for the potential interaction between symptoms. RESULTS: Among adolescents with probable asthma, EIW was associated with ED visits and hospitalizations. In multivariable models wheeze without a cold, chest tightness, night wakening, but not EIW, were significantly associated with both ED visits and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike findings with younger children, EIW does not appear to be associated with ED visits and hospitalizations among urban adolescents with probable asthma. Instead, symptoms, such as chest tightness and night wakening, appear to be important at identifying adolescents at risk for asthma-related urgent care.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,S0954-6111(18)30006-4 [pii]||10.1016/j.rmed.2018.01.005 [doi],NLM,15323064

The results indicated that YTHDF1 significantly upregulated in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Functionally, overexpression of YTHDF1 promoted the proliferation and migration of ASMCs, while YTHDF1 knockdown repressed the proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, there was a m(6)A modification site on cyclin D1 RNA (CCND1 genome) and YTHDF1 combined with cyclin D1 mRNA, thereby enhancing its mRNA stability via m6A-dependent manner.

However, the genetic role underlying MMP-1 in the context of asthma has remained enigmatic, with its full implications yet to be unveiled. Considering this, our research was designed to investigate the association of MMP-1 -1607 rs1799750 and the propensity for asthma severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a case-control investigation, our study enrolled 198 individuals diagnosed with asthma and age- and sex-matched 453 non-asthmatic controls. The genotypes of MMP-1 rs1799750 were determined utilizing the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. RESULTS: The frequency distributions of 2G/2G, 1G/2G and 1G/1G genotypes at MMP-1 rs1799750 were 49, 42.9, and 8.1%, respectively, among the patients with asthma. This pattern was not different from that of controls (43.7, 46.8, and 9.5%, respectively) (p for trend=0.4486). The allelic frequency pertaining to the variant 1G allele within the asthma group was 29.5%, with a non-significant disparity compared to the 32.9% in the control group (p=0.2596). Noticeably, there was a positive association between MMP-1 rs1799750 2G/1G and 1G/1G genotypes with asthma severity (p=0.0060). CONCLUSION: Our research indicated that the presence of MMP-1 rs1799750 1G allele might not be the sole arbiter of an individual's susceptibility to asthma, yet its potential to function as a discerning prognostic marker for the severity of asthma emerged as a noteworthy finding deserving attention and further exploration.",Journal Article,,38/1/365 [pii]||10.21873/invivo.13447 [doi],NLM,17917549

To accomplish this, CASI surveyed Chicago-area hospitals, emergency departments, primary care physicians, specialty care physicians, pharmacists, managed care organizations, the general public, and persons or families affected by asthma to learn about asthma care and its outcomes. A variety of techniques (including brochures, slide kits, and the Internet) were used to achieve rapid public dissemination of study findings. The value of this comprehensive community-based data surveillance effort will rest on how the community uses this information to stimulate new efforts to improve asthma care and reduce untoward outcomes.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,S0012-3692(15)30714-5 [pii]||10.1378/chest.116.suppl_2.141s [doi],NLM,00123692

METHODS: This cross-sectional investigation was conducted on caregivers visiting the pediatrics clinic at the Jordan University Hospital and King Abdullah University Hospital between December 2021 and January 2023. KAP were measured using a literature-validated questionnaire. Differences in KAP scores across participants' characteristics were examined using the student-t test and ANOVA. RESULTS: A total of 108 caregivers were included in the final analysis. Caregivers were aged 30 to 40 years (54.6%) and had at least secondary education (90.7%). The majority of participants displayed appropriate knowledge with respect to asthma's clinical course. Furthermore, the greater portion of caregivers were knowledgeable about preventing asthma attacks and treating their children during said attacks. Factors affecting knowledge of asthma included age of mothers (p < .05). On the other hand, attitude scores were affected by occupation, type of medication, and family history of asthma (all p < .05). Moreover, employee mothers, children well controlled on both Asthma Control Test and Global Initiative for Asthma scores, and having no pediatric intensive care unit admissions were associated with higher practice treatment scores (all p < .05). Overall practice score was weakly, yet positively correlated with knowledge scores (r = 0.195, p = .043). Similarly, negative attitudes were weakly correlated with higher knowledge scores (r = 0.199, p = .039). CONCLUSION: While the knowledge and practice scores were satisfactory, the clinical status of children with asthma was unsatisfactory. Future studies should examine factors associated with caregiver insecurity and measure their extent of applying asthma prevention guidelines.","Journal Article||Multicenter Study||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,10.1080/02770903.2023.2289165 [doi],NLM,15324303

We compared different definitions of childhood asthma, identified characteristics that might have influenced their accuracy and an acquisition of an 'asthma' label in wheezy and treated children. METHODS: Using a prospective, population-based birth cohort of 623 children followed up to the age of 14 years the concordance between parental opinion, doctor's diagnosis reported by the parent and asthma's diagnosis in general practice (GP) was analysed using latent class analysis (LCA). RESULTS: At the age of eight, 'ever asthma' prevalences ranged from 15.5% (parental opinion) to 21.5% (GP record). 35% of children by the age of eight years had at least one reported label of asthma, reflecting both cross sectional and longitudinal inconsistencies. By the age of 14 years, 16% of children were inconsistently defined as 'ever asthmatic' by their parents. The prevalence of 'ever asthma' estimated by LCA was 19.3%, indicating a parental report of a doctor's diagnosis to be the most sensitive and specific definition. The likelihood of being labelled with asthma was higher in those with a parental or sibling history of asthma, but not determined by socio-demographic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Although the estimates of prevalence were similar for parental reports and GP records, agreement between the three sources was less than expected.

OBJECTIVE: To identify gene expression signatures that reflect asthma-related processes and to determine whether these genes were similar or distinct between stable asthma and acute exacerbations in childhood, we profiled gene expression patterns in nasal respiratory epithelial cells. METHODS: Children who had stable asthma (asthma-S; n = 10) and children experiencing an asthma exacerbation (asthma-E; n = 10) were recruited along with nonatopic children without asthma (n = 10). RNA was prepared from nasal respiratory epithelial cells isolated from each child, initially analyzed as pooled samples from the 3 groups, and further validated by using microarrays and RT-PCR with individual patient samples. RESULTS: Distinct gene clusters were identifiable in individual and pooled asthma-S and asthma-E samples. Asthma-E samples demonstrated the strongest and most reproducible signatures, with 314 genes of 34,886 measured as present on the chip demonstrating induction or repression of greater than 2-fold with P < .05 in each of 4 individual samples. Asthma-S-regulated genes encompassed genes that overlapped with those of asthma-E but were fewer (166) and less consistent with respect to their behavior across the asthma-E patient samples. CONCLUSION: Exacerbated asthma status is readily distinguished based on the occurrence of strong gene expression signatures in nasal epithelial samples. Stable asthma status also exhibits differential signatures. The results suggest that there are independent gene expression signatures reflective of cells and genes poised or committed to activation by an asthma attack.","Journal Article||Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,S0091674904026880 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2004.10.032 [doi],NLM,00916749

OPTIONS: These guidelines are mainly directed towards OA induced by a workplace sensitizing agent. However, irritant-induced asthma and workplace aggravation of underlying asthma are also addressed, and some consideration is given to other differential diagnoses. OUTCOMES: To enable the assessing physician to investigate patients with possible OA appropriately and to provide guidelines for appropriate early referral when specialized investigations are required. To provide an understanding of the appropriate management strategies following objective diagnosis. EVIDENCE: The key diagnostic and management recommendations were based on a critical review of the literature and by specialist consensus meetings. VALUES: Evidence was categorized as follows. Level 1: Evidence from at least one randomized, controlled trial. Level 2: Evidence from at least one well-designed clinical trial without randomization, from cohort or case-control analytical studies, preferably from more than one centre, from multiple time series or from dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments. Level 3: Evidence from the opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies or reports of expert committees. Evidence was further subdivided as follows: A. Good evidence to support a recommendation for use; B. Moderate evidence to support a recommendation for use; C. Poor evidence to support a recommendation for or against use; D. Moderate evidence to support a recommendation against use; E. Good evidence to support a recommendation against use. BENEFITS, HARM AND COSTS: The medical and socioeconomic risks and benefits of an incorrect diagnosis of OA and of failure to diagnose true OA were considered in the recommendations. VALIDATION: The document has been reviewed and endorsed by the Canadian Thoracic Society, the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and The College of Family Physicians of Canada. CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence for rapid investigation and objective categorization of presented symptoms into OA, aggravation of underlying asthma, unrelated asthma or other diagnoses. OA should be suspected in all adult onset asthmatics whose asthma begins or worsens while they are working. Investigations should be directed to an objective assessment of asthma and then to an assessment of the work relationship, using a combination of investigations as feasible, which may include immunological tests, pulmonary function assessed during work periods and away from work, and specific challenge tests. Early specialist referral is recommended for diagnosis. Management strategies include general asthma management in addition to measures to avoid further exposure to a relevant workplace sensitizer. Compensation issues and other workers at risk of developing OA also need to be considered when the diagnosis is made.",Guideline||Journal Article||Practice Guideline,,10.1155/1998/587580 [doi],NLM,11982241

DESIGN AND METHODS: Children 2 to 18 years old who presented to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's ED with acute asthma exacerbations were enrolled prospectively. Parents and patients completed the 108-item Asthma Exacerbation Response Questionnaire with a focus on determining the home management steps they took both at the onset of the asthma exacerbation and just before coming to the ED. RESULTS: Among the 433 children studied, 76% had at least 1 doctor visit, 75% had at least 1 ED visit, and 43% had at least 1 hospitalization for asthma in the preceding 12 months. Overall, 64% had persistent asthma by NHLBI criteria, yet just 4% were cared for by an allergist or pulmonologist, 38% took daily anti-inflammatory therapy, and 18% received a daily inhaled corticosteroid. Also, 48% did not use a holding chamber with their metered-dose inhalers, and 66% did not use their peak flow meters. Regarding exacerbation response, 71% did not have a written action plan, and 89% did not maintain a symptom diary. Both at the onset of wheezing and just before coming to the ED, administration of a beta2-agonist was the only step that the majority of children performed. One-third or fewer followed the other steps recommended by the NHLBI, including using a peak flow meter, beginning oral corticosteroids, calling or going to see the doctor, or going to the ED. Children with persistent asthma were not more adherent to the guidelines than those with mild intermittent disease. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma has a significant adverse effect on the lives of these children. The NHLBI guidelines, first published a decade ago, were designed to reduce asthma's increasing morbidity and mortality, but this study uncovered a high rate of nonadherence with many aspects of the guidelines, including preventive strategies and home management of an exacerbation.",Journal Article,,108/6/1332 [pii]||10.1542/peds.108.6.1332 [doi],NLM,10984275

Respiratory allergies may arise if two prerequisites exist firstly exposure to sensitizing agents in the work environment and secondly individual disposition to allergic reactions. The large range of sensitizing agents includes organic and inorganic substances derived from animals, plants, fungi, metals or chemicals. Most of them are responsible for Type-I IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Three different patterns of respiratory responses can be found following simulated occupational exposure: immediate, late (non-immediate), and the dual-type of asthmatic reaction, whereby the non-immediate asthmatic response must be strictly differentiated from the genuine Type-III hypersensitivity. Today, bakers' asthma is the most frequent and most costly occupational allergy in the FRG, contributing more than 50% of all registered and more than 75% of all compensated cases. Therefore, flour allergies can be used as a classic model of an occupational allergic disease in order to discuss epidemiological, social and clinical problems, such as prevalence, socioeconomic impact, as well as prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic measures. Despite many well-known clinical and epidemiological data, respiratory allergies display a lot of unresolved questions calling for further research.",Journal Article||Review,31.0,,NLM,03432432

For optimal effectiveness IT should be restricted to appropriately selected patients with proven IgE-mediated disease. IT has seldom the capacity to act as a curative treatment.

DATA SOURCES: Selected clinical guidelines, clinical articles, and research studies. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder with acute exacerbations that currently affects approximately 14 million-15 million children and adults in the United States. Costs for asthma are staggering and nurse practitioners (NPs) are frequently presented with management decisions for the acute treatment and chronic management of this disorder. Disparities exist with the occurrence of asthma between race and gender. Additionally, there is an increased incidence in acute exacerbations resulting from poor long-term control and follow-up care among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Standards of care, along with new and emerging treatment strategies, guide NPs in providing the most comprehensive care to those affected with this chronic disorder. Knowledge about the pathophysiology of asthma and correlated to the case presentation enhances understanding treatment strategies for NPs who are often faced with providing care for patients with this chronic disorder that may sometimes present in an acute exacerbation.",Case Reports||Journal Article,,10.1111/j.1745-7599.2002.tb00076.x [doi],NLM,10412972

We also investigated the effect of salbutamol inhalation on S(cond) and S(acin) in patients with asthma and compared it with that obtained in patients with COPD. Baseline measurements in the patients with asthma show that (1) acinar ventilation inhomogeneity was indeed abnormal in patients with asthma (S(acin) = 0.195 +/- 0.026 L-1) despite the normal diffusing capacity in this group; S(acin) values were intermediate between those obtained in unaffected individuals and patients with COPD, and that (2) conductive ventilation inhomogeneity was abnormal in the patients with asthma (S(cond) = 0.076 +/- 0.006 L-1) but similar to that obtained in the patients with COPD. Measurements after salbutamol inhalations showed significant changes in S(cond) and S(acin) only in the patients with asthma (p < 0.001).

Current guidelines state that diagnosis and treatment should be guided by symptoms and spirometry. FEV(1) is, however, a poor marker of small airway function and correlates poorly with asthma control and airway inflammation. AIMS: To assess the contribution of small airway dysfunction and inflammation in paediatric asthma. A secondary aim was to study the associations between small airway dysfunction, airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). METHODS: Small airway function was measured as LCI, S(cond) and S(acin), evaluated with the SF(6) multiple breath inert gas washout (MBW) technique, in 47 asthmatic children and 74 healthy controls. Exhaled NO at multiple exhalation flow rates including 50 mL/s (FENO(50)) was assessed to calculate alveolar NO and bronchial NO flux (a surrogate for airway inflammation). AHR was evaluated with isocapnoic dry air hyperventilation challenge in the asthmatic children. RESULTS: S(cond) was elevated in 31 (66%) and S(acin) in 18 (38%) of the asthmatic subjects. LCI was increased and FEV(1) decreased in 7 (15%) of the subjects with asthma. Individuals with AHR had higher S(cond) (p = 0.001) and FENO(50) (p < 0.0001) than those without AHR. The levels of FENO(50) and bronchial NO flux were elevated in asthmatic subjects compared with healthy controls. In asthma, S(cond) correlated with FENO(50) (r(s) = 0.42, p = 0.003) and alveolar NO (r(s) = 0.40, p = 0.011), and S(acin) correlated with alveolar NO (r(s) = 0.40, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Dysfunction of small conducting airways is associated with airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in paediatric asthma.","Comparative Study||Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,S0954-6111(11)00132-6 [pii]||10.1016/j.rmed.2011.04.004 [doi],NLM,15323064

It has been suggested that an S/R (Serine128Arginine) polymorphism of E-selectin alters ligand binding function. Our purpose in this study was to determine whether this Serine128Arginine polymorphism influences the risk of asthma and also to analyze the possible correlation of disease severity in Iranian patients with polymorphism of E-selection. We studied human E-selectin gene polymorphism in 172 asthmatic patients and 173 healthy volunteers by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). To determine the severity of the asthma's situation, a questionnaire was prepared requesting the following information: age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms and past medical history. After the participants filled in the questionnaire, all active or ex-smoker patients were excluded. A trained observer assessed airway reversibility, peak flowmetry and spirometry in asthmatic patients. We found increased serum levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in asthmatic patients compared with healthy subjects (P<0. 0001). Frequencies of the SS, SR, and RR genotypes were found as 66.3%, 31.4%, and 2.3% in the patients and 91.9%, 8.1%, and 0.0% in control subjects, respectively. The 128Arg allele was more prevalent in patients than controls (OR 5.78; 95% CI, 3.07-10.86, P<0.0001). However, in this study the polymorphism was not associated with circulating sE-selectin levels. We found a direct correlation between the level of sE-selectin and the severity of asthma (P=0.001). On the other hand, there was a close relation between 128Arginine carriage and disease severity (P<0.0001). These results suggest that the Ser128Arg polymorphism of the E-selectin gene is a genetic factor that may be associated with the severity of asthma.",Journal Article,,06024957 [pii],NLM,17351502

ECP is released by activated eosinophils and regarded as a marker of eosinophilic inflammation. High levels of ECP have been reported in cases of active asthma and other allergic diseases. This study aimed to assess whether three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ECP gene (RNASE3) on chromosome 14 q24-q31 or their haplotypes are associated with asthma, allergy, or related phenotypes. METHODS: The three SNPs -38CA, +371CG and +499CG in RNASE3 and their haplotypes were analyzed for associations with asthma, serum-ECP (s-ECP) levels, allergic sensitization (positive skin-prick test to common allergens), bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) assessed by methacholine inhalation, and serum-IgE (s-IgE) levels in 177 families from Norway and the Netherlands identified through siblings with asthma. RESULTS: Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) demonstrated significant associations between the A-G-G haplotype and asthma as well as the specific phenotypes allergic asthma (but not non-allergic asthma), high s-ECP, high s-IgE and BHR, while the C-G-G haplotype was associated with reduced occurrence of these traits. In addition, the -38A allele was associated with high s-ECP levels and allergic asthma. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the A-G-G haplotype in the RNASE3 gene influences the development of asthma, in particular, an allergic form of asthma. Furthermore, as the -38CA SNP lies in close vicinity of known intron-regulatory sites, results of SNP analysis suggest that the detected association is possibly linked to a genetic transcriptional control of s-ECP levels.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,ALL1327 [pii]||10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01327.x [doi],NLM,01054538

Our meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the emerging paradigms. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, ISI web of knowledge, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. We applied Bonferroni step-down and Benjamini-Hochberg step-up methods to adjust the values for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 12 individual studies in 11 articles were included in the meta-analysis. For GT repeat polymorphism, the S allele had approximately 45% increased risk of asthma (S vs. L: OR  =  1.45, 95% CI  =  1.22-1.71, P(UNCORRECTED) < 0.001, P(Bon) < 0.001, P(FDR) < 0.001). Further analysis indicated that GT13 and GT14 contributed to asthma risk, whereas GT15 and GT16 were protective (GT13 vs. GT15: OR  =  1.38, 95% CI  =  1.16-1.65, P(UNCORRECTED ) =  0.001, P(Bon) =  0.005, P(FDR) = 0.002). Similar results were obtained in the subgroup analysis of Asian population. G2964A polymorphism analysis showed that the AA genotype moderately increased the risk of asthma by 47% compared with the GG genotype (OR  =  1.47, p  =  0.068) in Chinese population, whereas the 2964A allele moderately increased the risk of asthma in Chinese population by 18% (2964A vs. 2964G: OR  =  1.18, p =  0.08). However, none of the associations reached statistically significant levels particularly after correction for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that S allele (GT13 and GT14) of the GT repeat polymorphism confers significant risks to asthma. However, the G2964A polymorphism does not have an association with the susceptibility to asthma.","Journal Article||Meta-Analysis||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,PONE-D-13-05100 [pii]||10.1371/journal.pone.0067657 [doi],NLM,19326203

Environmental factors may play an important role in this trend. We aimed to investigate the relationship of weather conditions and air pollution to significant exacerbation of asthma. METHODS: The daily number of emergency department (ED) visits by ambulance for asthma was collected through records of the Tokyo Fire Department from January 1 to December 31, 2005. We also collected daily air pollution levels and meteorological data for Tokyo during the same period. Meteorological data included minimum temperature, maximum barometric pressure, maximum relative humidity, and precipitation. Measured air pollutants included sulfur dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen oxides, suspended particulate matter, and carbon monoxide. We performed a time series analysis using multivariable-adjusted autoregressive integrated moving average model. The analysis was conducted separately among adults and among children (<15 years old). RESULTS: Of a total of 643,849 patients who were transported to the ED by ambulance, there were 6447 patients with exacerbation of asthma. Among adults, lower minimum temperature was significantly associated with increased transport. Among children, there were no significant associations between exacerbation of asthmas requiring emergency transport and air pollutants or meteorological factors. The highest number of transports was found on October 11, the day after the National Sports Day in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Cold temperature is related to an increased risk of significant exacerbation of asthma in adults.

Although Schizophyllum commune (S. commune, ""suehirotake"" in Japanese), one of the basidiomycetous (BM) fungi, is a fungus that can cause allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) and allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS), whether the fungus causes or sensitizes subjects to asthma is unclear. METHODS: The bronchial provocation test using S. commune antigen was performed in two asthmatics who had demonstrated positive skin reactions to the S. commune antigen, and low dose of itraconazole (50 mg/day) was prescribed as an adjunctive therapy for 2 weeks. The allergological features and clinical manifestations of these patients are herein evaluated and discussed. RESULTS: Case 1 was a 71-year-old female, and case 2 was a 69-year-old male. Both patients demonstrated positive reactions to the inhalation test. A diagnosis of AFS or ABPM was excluded in both patients because of the lack of a history of pulmonary infiltrates, central bronchiectasis, a history of expectoration of brown plugs or flecks, or sinusoidal findings. Although the efficacy of itraconazole in our cases was unclear, the elevated titer of the specific IgG-for S. commune in case 2 gradually decreased during the period of antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The two patients described herein were diagnosed to have bronchial asthma caused by S. commune; so-called Schizophyllum asthma. S. commune may also be a causative fungal antigen of bronchial asthma.","Case Reports||Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,S1094-5539(11)00084-8 [pii]||10.1016/j.pupt.2011.04.030 [doi],NLM,15229629

Edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in airway is observed in the asthmatic patients. One of the essential changes in inflammation is adhesion of leukocyte to endothelium and transmigration of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation. Unfortunately, little is known about the role of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) polymorphism in asthma inflammatory process. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PECAM-1 polymorphisms affect the risk of asthma or not.Forty-five asthmatic patients (including 27 men and 18 women) and 45 healthy volunteers (11 men and 34 women) were studied. To determine the severity of the asthmas situation, a questionnaire was prepared asking the following information: age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms and past medical history. All subjects were genotyped for PECAM-1 polymorphism by using amplification refractory mutation system -polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). The genotype distribution of PECAM-1 80 Val/Met polymorphism in all asthmatic patients were Val/Val while non asthmatic controls were 95.6% Val/Val and 4.4% Val/Met. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p<0.05). The allele and genotype frequencies of PECAM-1 125 Val/Leu polymorphism were significantly different between asthmatic patients and controls. On the other hand, the presence of 125 Leu allele was associated with an increasing risk of asthma with an odds ratio of 2.8 (95% CI; 1.5-5.3, p=0.002).

DESIGN: This is case and control study. SETTING: The study was carried out among school children living and attending the school in industrial and residential area during the period of October 2004 and June 2005. SUBJECTS: The study based on age, sex, and ethnicity of 716 cases (with asthma) and 716 controls (without asthma) school children living in both urban and in industrial polluted with oil refinery and chemical pollutant. METHODS: The International study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC) and some additional questionnaires were used to collect the data of the school children. The questionnaire included information about: socio-demographic characteristics; respiratory symptoms; associated respiratory illness; family history of allergic diseases among first-degree relatives of asthmatic children; behavioural factors which could be additive to asthma. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The proportion of children in the asthmatic group who reported symptoms was significantly higher than in non-asthmatic group (<0.0001). The asthmatic group reported that 47.5% morning time breathlessness, shortness of breath (61.4%), wheeze after exercise (65.4%), phlegm (45.3%) and chronic cough (42.2%). Male asthmatics had a average age at onset of symptoms of 6.9% (+/-4.8%) years compared with female asthmatics who had higher age at onset of symptoms, 7.6 (+/-5.9). Male asthmatics also had longer duration of symptoms (7.5 +/- 4.9 in males and 6.4 +/- 4.6 years in females). Significantly odds ratios were found higher in asthmatic compared to controls for pneumonia, bronchitis, atopy (allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis), sinusitis, croup, parental asthmas, parental atopy including parental allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and parental smoking (p < 0.0001). The logistic regression model showed that shortness of breath, bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, parental asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, croup, pets ownership and parental smoking were significant risk factors for asthma CONCLUSION: The present study provides some evidence that exposure to outdoor air pollutants increases the risk of childhood asthma and allergic diseases in school children. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that long term exposure to NOx and CO levels suggests that emissions from photochemical air pollution and oil refinery contributes to adverse health effects in Qatar.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,NLM,17641489

However the relation of clinical classification with the functional data is not well defined. PURPOSE: To correlate the clinical evaluation of asthma with the most usual parameters of larger and smaller airways bronchial obstruction, PFR and FEV1.n MATERIAL AND METHODS: 153 patients have been studied by spirometry on absence of bronchodilator or anti inflammatory therapy in the last few days. Clinically, they were classified following the 2002 revised strategy for asthma management (NIH), 66 as mild intermitent, 61 mild persistent and 26 moderate persistent asthmas. RESULTS: In mild intermitent asthma PFR was decreased in 53 patients (80.3%) and FEV1 in 51 (77.2%). In mild persistent PFR and FEV1 were decreased in 59 (96.7%). In medium persistent asthma PFR was decreased in 25 (96.0%) and FEV1 in 24 (92%). The values of PFR and FEV1 were statistically different in intermitent and persistent asthma. For PFR square chi X2 = 8.91, p < 0.01 and for FEV1 X2 = 9.0 p < 0.01. In contrast there were no statistically differences between mild and moderate persistent asthmas. For PFR X2 = 0.02 p < 0.8 and for FEV1 X2 = 0.039, p < 0.9 (tables 1, 2, 3, 4). DISCUSSION: The occurrence of 77.2% and 80.3% of decreased FEV1 and PFR values in non dyspnea as reported by the patients. There were also no functional differences between patients in the different groups of persistent asthma. Clinical and functional data must be correlated, case by case in order to establish a correct classification of asthmatic patients and improve therapy and the relation between lung function and clinic reevaluate.",Journal Article,,,NLM,17641489

To estimate the appropriateness of treatment and management of asthma in Spain during the period of 1991 and 1992, we analyzed data from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). METHOD: The ECRHS was undertaken with a random sample of 20-to-44-year-olds in Albacete, Barcelona, Galdakao, Huelva and Oviedo. In total, 181 individuals with asthma were identified. Current asthma was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms associated with asthma within the past 12 months and a positive methacholine challenge test. RESULTS: Subjects who were unaware of having asthma made up 57.5% (CI: 49.9-64.8%), and 35.9% (CI: 27.9-42.3%) were not following any specific treatment. Among asthmatics who reported having continuous or frequent respiratory symptoms, 25.9% (CI: 15.3-39.0%) were not following any treatment. CONCLUSION: Over half the individuals with asthma in 1991 to 1993 were unaware of having the disease at the time of the study or of ever having had it, and approximately one third were not in treatment. The delivery of appropriate treatment in asthma generally, and in asthma with continuous or frequent respiratory symptoms, was markedly inadequate during the period studied.","English Abstract||Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,S0300-2896(15)30259-3 [pii]||10.1016/s0300-2896(15)30259-3 [doi],NLM,03002896

Parent or student surveys are the most common method of collecting these data. However, medical literature offers little guidance to help schools determine whether parents or students are the most appropriate and effective source of asthma-related information. This study compares student and parent responses to the same set of asthma-related questions. In general, parents and students have a high level of agreement in reporting the absence of an asthma diagnosis or asthma symptoms. When parents and students disagreed, students reported many more asthmalike symptoms, especially symptoms with exercise and symptoms at night, than did their parents. The disparity in student and parent symptom reporting did not vary by age of the student.

METHODS: This study included 34 children with atypical asthmas who underwent bronchial provocation test between January 2010 and December 2013. Thirty-four children with typical asthmas were selected as the control group. The pulmonary function of the atypical asthma group was examined before and after the bronchial provocation test and compared with that of the control group in the acute episode and remission stages. RESULTS: The forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow 25%, 50%, 75% (FEF25, FEF50, FEF75), and maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF75/25) in the atypical asthma group before the bronchial provocation test were (105+/-12)%, (104+/-12)%, (100+/-7)%, (88+/-13)%, (90+/-14)%, (81+/-17)%, (73+/-25)%, and (80+/-17)%, respectively; these functional indices were significantly higher than in the control group in the acute episode stage (P<0.05), but were similar to those of the control group in the remission stage (P>0.05).

The pathogenesis of VCD has not been clearly defined but it is possible to recognize non-psychologic and psychologic causes. The majority of patients are female but, interestingly, a high incidence of VCD has been documented in health care workers. A misdiagnosis with asthma leads to hospitalisation, unnecessary use of systemic steroids with related adverse effects, and sometimes tracheostomy and intubation. In a subset of VCD patients, the disease can be attributed to occupational or environmental exposure to inhaled irritants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman, working as a nurse, who complained of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea related to inhalation of irritating agents (isopropylic alcohol, formaldehyde, peracetic acid). She underwent chest radiography, pulmonary function assessment both in the presence and in the absence of symptoms, bronchial provocation with methacholine and bronchodilation test with salbutamol to recognize asthma's features, allergy evaluation by skin prick tests and patch tests and video-laryngoscopy. RESULTS: VCD diagnosis was made on the basis of video-laryngoscopy, that visualized the paradoxical motion of the vocal cords during symptoms, in the absence of other pathologic processes. CONCLUSIONS: This case fulfils the proposed criteria for the diagnosis of irritant VCD (IVCD). This is the first report of VCD onset following exposure to several irritants: formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, sopropylic alcohol, peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture. These substances are used as cleaning and antiseptic agents in healthcare settings and some ones can also be found in many indoor environments.

Data base on death certificates from the National Ministry of Health were evaluated. They were individualized for COPD: ICD-9: 490 to 496 and ICD-10: J-40 to J47; for asthma: ICD-9: 493 and ICD-10: J44, J45-J46. Global mortality rate was calculated from each code and for 24 provinces. For asthma, the adjusted mortality rate for 5-34 year-old patients was calculated. Population data were provided by National Institute of Statistics and Census. Global mortality rate for asthma increased from 3.37 in 1980 to 3.96/100,000 in 1985 and decreased from 3.16 in 1991 to 1.74 in 1997 (-30.8%, p < 0.0001) and increased to 2.18 in 1998. Asthma's 5-34 year old mortality rate increased from 0.72 in 1980 to 1.12/100,000 in 1986, and decreased to 0.35 in 1998 (-70%, p < 0.0001). Global mortality rate for COPD increased from 12.76/100,000 in 1980 to 27.16/100,000 in 1998 (+113%, p < 0.0001). There were marked inter-provinces differences for asthma and COPD.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine whether we could demonstrate a relationship between emergency room visits for asthma and alterations in environmental conditions. METHODS: Over a 1-year period, the frequency of emergency room visits for asthma in a large urban hospital were documented and compared to outdoor concentrations of SO2, NO2, and ozone in addition to two overall measures of air quality (air pollution index and air quality index). RESULTS: A total of 854 emergency room visits were noted with the highest number of visits occurring in May and between September and December. Significant variations in the frequency of visits as well as environmental conditions could be seen on a daily basis. Despite comparisons of results on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, no significant relationships could be found between any of the pollution indices and emergency room visits. Staggering visits by 1 and 7 days, however, revealed a relationship between emergency room visits and air pollution index and air quality index. An association between emergency room visits and NO2 and ozone was seen when visits were staggered by 7 but not by 1 day. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude the fluctuations in overall air quality are associated with increased frequency of emergency room visits but only when data are lagged by a predefined period.",Journal Article,,,NLM,10811206

Most of these studies have been cross-sectional which substantially limits their power to analyse genotype/phenotype associations. Asthma is a such a highly variable condition that future genotype/phenotype studies should use longitudinal data. Populations with extensive long-term longitudinal data will facilitate more precise definition of phenotype and allow analysis of asthma's natural history. Longitudinal information also means that each phenotypic attribute can be quantified and considered with respect to age. Collecting longitudinal data prospectively would be extremely expensive and take many years. Using existing longitudinal data sets would clearly be much quicker and more economical, but there are very few suitable data sets to be found. Studying a normal and an asthmatic population is ideal and would provide complementary genotype/phenotype information. This approach is a logical step to using the genotypic information obtained from cross-sectional molecular genetic studies to more critically establish the effect of genotype on phenotype.",Journal Article,,10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.0280s1046.x [doi],NLM,09547894

The primary objective in treating nocturnal asthma is to help patients sleep through the night. The bronchoconstriction that underlies nocturnal asthmatic symptoms is a reflection of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and this hyperresponsiveness is greatly increased by airway inflammation. In patients with allergic asthma, airway inflammation can be reduced by reducing exposure to allergens and, in some cases, by immunotherapy.

METHODS: A search was conducted in the all states database of Westlaw to identify which the US states, territories, and the District of Columbia have a law for K-12 schools. Terms searched included (inhaler or asthma/s medic!) and school and (prescription or order) from conception to December 2020. Demographic data from states with and without a policy were compared. All policies were examined for the following components: (1) type of law (statute or regulation); (2) type of school (charter, private/parochial or public); (3) training requirements; (4) devices; (5) prescriptive authority/safe harbor; (6) medication requirements; and (7) mandated documentation, reporting and funding. RESULTS: Our systematic search revealed 15 locations with existing laws. States with a law had a higher percentage of children under 17-years than states without a law (p = .02). Common components described were the applicability to various types of schools, training requirements for those empowered to administer, and civil liability protections for trained school personnel. CONCLUSIONS: Existing stock inhaler laws differ vastly across the United States that may impact access to stock albuterol for children at their schools.",Journal Article||Systematic Review,,10.1111/josh.13142 [doi],NLM,17461561

Epub 2017 Mar 10.,Molecular pharmacology,1521-0111 (Electronic) 0026-895X (Linking),United States,"We have reported that phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at Ser(226) reduces GR nuclear translocation, resulting in corticosteroid insensitivity in patients with severe asthmas. A serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A, which regulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 and GR-Ser(226) signaling, is involved in this mechanism. Here, we further explored protein kinase dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) with the ability to dephosphorylate JNK, and identified DUSP4 as a phosphatase involved in the regulation of corticosteroid sensitivity. The effects of knocking down DUSPs (DUSP1, 4, 8, 16, and 22) by small interfering RNA (siRNA) were evaluated in a monocytic cell line (U937). Corticosteroid sensitivity was determined by dexamethasone enhancement of FK506-binding protein 51 or inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced interferon gamma and interleukin 8 expression and GR translocation from cell cytoplasm to nucleus. The nuclear/cytoplasmic GR, phosphorylation levels of GR-Ser(226) and JNK1, coimmunoprecipitated GR-JNK1-DUSP4, and DUSP4 expression were analyzed by western blotting and/or imaging flow cytometry. Phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitated (IP)-DUSP4 was measured by fluorescence-based assay. Knockdown of DUSP4 enhanced phosphorylation of GR-Ser(226) and JNK1 and reduced GR nuclear translocation and corticosteroid sensitivity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that DUSP4 is associated with GR and JNK1. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells from severe asthmatics, DUSP4 expression was reduced versus healthy subjects and negatively correlated with phosphorylation levels of GR-Ser(226) and JNK1. Formoterol enhanced DUSP4 activity and restored corticosteroid sensitivity reduced by DUSP4 siRNA. In conclusion, DUSP4 regulates corticosteroid sensitivity via dephosphorylation of JNK1 and GR-Ser(226) DUSP4 activation by formoterol restores impaired corticosteroid sensitivity, indicating that DUSP4 is crucial in regulating corticosteroid sensitivity, and therefore might be a novel therapeutic target in severe asthma.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,mol.116.107656 [pii]||10.1124/mol.116.107656 [doi],NLM,15210111

Size of flow volume curve (= AUFVC) has been commonly recognized to be changeable visually in patients with asthma. To clarify whether size of flow volume curve (= AUFVC) is a useful index of the course of bronchial asthma, we compared the rate of improvement forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or forced vital capacity (FVC) to the rate of improvement in AUFVC after admission in 20 patients with bronchial asthma. The rate of improvement in AUFVC positively correlated with the rate of improvement in FEV1.0, PEFR or FVC. AUFVC demonstrated more marked improvement than other indices. Since AUFVC reflects the momentum of expired air, bronchial asthma's patients could understand visually that the momentum of expired air decreased due to airway stenosis by presenting flow volume curve. Therefore, visual size of flow volume curve helped patients with asthma to understand the condition of asthma.

The aim of this work was to study the chronological characteristics of occupational asthma of different etiologies and to understand the occupational after-effects. A series of 144 cases were analysed (115 men and 29 women) who were seen in a consultation that specialised in occupational pathology, with the inclusion criteria those of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The analysis was based on: the causative allergen or work protocol; the role of atopy; length of the latency phase; length of symptom exposure; diagnosis delay; occupational consequences. Asthma from isocyanates and flour between them accounted for 62% in this series. These were followed by asthma from wood (8.3%) and persulphates (7.6%).

The aim of this study was to analyze the miRNA profile in patients with mild asthma and an HDM allergy after bronchial allergen provocation (BAP). Seventeen patients with EAR/no LAR and 17 patients with EAR plus LAR, determined by a significant fall in FEV1 after BAP, were differentially analyzed. As expected, patients with EAR plus LAR showed a more pronounced allergic inflammation and FEV1 delta drop after 24 h. NGS-miRNA analysis identified the down-regulation of miR-15a-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-374a-5p after BAP with the highest significance in patients with EAR plus LAR, which were negatively correlated with eNO and the maximum decrease in FEV1. These miRNAs have shared targets like CCND1, VEGFA, and GSK3B, which are known to be involved in airway remodeling, basement membrane thickening, and Extracellular Matrix deposition.

The regulation of histamine release is mostly done by cyclic AMP and GMP and the membrane receptors H2. The test of histamine release on whole blood or on leucocypte suspension enables by the study of effect-dose curves to differentiate the histamine release mechanisms: bell shaped curve in the case of immunitary processus and ascending curve for an irrative phenomenon.

METHOD: Ninety cases with asthma in remission were randomly divided into three groups and each group contained thirty patients who received SIT respectively with atomization inhalation (A group), sublingual contained (B group) and hypodermic injection (C group). 32 healthy subjects were as control group. Before and after treatment, the expression of IL-2 and IL-4, total IgE level were measured by radio-immune. The three SIT treatments were evaluated. RESULT: Before SIT treatment, compared with the normal control group, the patients' serum level of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and total IgE had significantly increased, the level of Th1 cytokines IL-2 had significantly reduced. There were statistical significance between the asthma and normal control (t = 4.869, 5.598, 10.009, P < 0.01). After 12 months SIT treatment, the patients' serum IL-2 showed increased, the serum IL-4 and total IgE showed reduced, the difference was statistical significant (t = 7.303, 2.494, 2.225, P < 0.05). There was good positive correlation between the level of IL-4 and the total IgE (r = 0.264, P < 0.01), there was good negative correlation between the level of IL-2 and the total IgE (r = -0.369, P < 0.001), and there was good negative correlation between the level of IL-2 and IL-4 (r = -0.277, P < 0.01). The effects among A, B, C groups were similar (all were over 86%), without statistical significance (chi2 = 0.055, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The specific response to antigen may be transferred from Th2 to Th1 by SIT with AV atomization inhalation, and mediated between balance of Th1/Th2 in patients with asthma. This method is thought a direct influence on the target organ. It is safe, simple and valid and can be easily accepted by sufferers.","English Abstract||Journal Article||Randomized Controlled Trial||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,NLM,

M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy in 1995-1998. RESULTS: Clinical and statistical analysis of BA clinical course allowed to single out three leading variants of BA course: persistently obstructive (stable and definite respiratory disturbances with progressive deterioration of bronchial permeability), moist (associated chronic bronchitis, allergic rhinosinusopathy, chronic maxillary sinusitis, intestinal dysbacteriosis, repulsive symptoms, e.g. discharge of much sputum et cet), paroxysmal (short-term episodes of asphyxia arrested by inhalations of beta 2-agonists, absence of stable respiratory disorders). The above variants of BA course significantly correlated with types of the internal picture (IP) and types of nosogenies. Persistently obstructive, moist and paroxysmal BA variants were characterized with vital, defensive and coping IP, respectively, neurotic reactions with hypochondria, hypochondriac depressions; pathocharacterological sensitive reactions; neurotic and affective reactions with ""la belle indifference"" and ""euphoric pseudodementia"", respectively.

In view of the complexity of the asthmatic attack the diagnosis must include all relevant parameters as otherwise consistent treatment is impossible. The only causal therapy is avoidance of exposure to antigens and also to unspecific (physicochemical) noxae which are nearly always superimposed. The value of specific immunotherapy varies according to the antigen or combination of antigens. The final verdict has to await the results of controlled studies in carefully classified and analysed groups, including investigations of immune parameters and uninterrupted registration of exposure to antigens. Until the efficiency, indications and mode of application of immunotherapy have been clearly established desensitization is preferable, provided the allergen has been identified and proved to be active, and exposure to the antigen cannot be avoided. The relatively high success rate obtained with placebos is presumably attributable to concurrent symptomatic treatment and avoidance of contact with the antigen. The already broad spectrum of adjuvent therapy is being constantly and successfully enlarged. Attempts to stimulate the production of antigen-specific suppressor T-cells by denatured antigens, and thereby prevent IgE production, are promising.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the tailored education program. METHODS: Caregivers including children with asthma were recruited during visits to a national children's hospital and those whose month-long asthma condition on the JPAC (Japanese Pediatric Asthma Program) score was 14 and below were included. Caregivers were randomized to the tailored education (intervention group) or non-tailored education (control group). The intervention group underwent a patient education program using a touch-screen computer, and they received tailored messages generated by a computer program. A research nurse and clinical psychologist used a computer-based resource to tailor the education messages and provided counseling using motivational interviewing for the caregivers including children with asthma. The control group received only a booklet on asthma. RESULTS: Forty-seven subjects aged 1 to 6 years were enrolled. Forty-seven caregivers were randomized to the tailored education (n=22) or non-tailored education (n=25) group. The results of two-way ANOVA showed that interactions between groups were observed in the score of JPAC and asthma knowledge for preschool children whose asthma onset was within one year and a half. The main effects of time were observed in the total and subscale score of QOL (Quality of Life) and the total score of P-CASES (Parental Childhood Asthma's Self-efficacy Scale). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate the benefit of a tailored education program to control symptoms in such caregivers.",English Abstract||Journal Article||Randomized Controlled Trial,,063020187e [pii],NLM,00214884

The tendency to increased nocturnal bronchoconstriction in some asthmatic subjects is well known. The reasons of such individual variations are different concentrations of cortisol, adrenaline, histamine, cAMP in serum as well as imbalance between vagal and sympathetic interactions. In practice, the early diagnosis of severe nocturnal bronchial constriction is important for prevention of asthma attacks and status asthmaticus. We report on our circadian measurements of airway resistance (Ros) or peak-flow. By adequate therapy an improvement of the individual bronchial tolerance could be achieved, however the biorhythm remained unchanged. Measurements of airway resistance at 2 a.m. were significantly improved by therapy, as was the mean level measurements during 4-hourly readings.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study of non-smoking, asthmatic adults in Scotland was to determine the correlation between the results from a standard spirometry test, forced expiratory volume in one-second percent (FEV1 %), and quantitative estimates of some biological exposures. METHODS: A population (n = 55) of non-smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland was included in this study and each completed a questionnaire that allowed the determination of the Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (ACQ) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ), as well as corticosteroid use. Spirometry testing was completed and the pre-bronchodilator FEV1 % value calculated. At about the same time, floor dust samples were collected in the living room and in the bedroom. These dust samples were analysed for mould contamination, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values and by (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan concentrations, for endotoxin, and for dust mite, cat, and dog allergen concentrations. The asthmatics' FEV1 % values were tested for correlation (Pearson) to questionnaire-based estimates of health. Also, each biological exposure was tested for correlation (Pearson) to the FEV1 % values. RESULTS: FEV1 % results were correlated with ACQ scores (rho -0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (rho -0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (rho -0.221, P = 0.105). The ERMI values in the homes (average 5.3) were significantly correlated with FEV1 % values (rho -0.378, P = 0.004). There was no correlation between FEV1 % and concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan, or any of the allergens. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although these results do not prove that mould exposures caused the deficit in lung function observed in this study, it might be advisable for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,CEA12482 [pii]||10.1111/cea.12482 [doi],NLM,13652222

METHODS: Data from the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases during 1992-2001 were analysed. Incidence rates for skin and respiratory diseases of machinists were calculated and compared to the total working population. The patients investigated at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in the same period were described in detail. RESULTS: A total of 279 dermatoses and 34 ARDs were reported. Skin diseases accounted for 27% of all occupational diseases. The incidences of the skin and respiratory diseases were 1.6 and 0.2 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively. This represents a 3-fold risk for getting an OSD compared to the total working population. The number of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) increased 3-fold during the study period. The most common causes of ACD were metalworking fluids (MWFs) and their ingredients such as formaldehyde, ethanolamines and colophony. Eighty-five per cent of ARDs were asthmas. The commonest causes of asthma were metal dusts and fumes, epoxy resins and hardeners and MWFs and their components. CONCLUSIONS: Contact dermatitis is a common occupational health problem in metalworking machinists, whereas occupational respiratory disease is rare. Only a few specific chemicals in the metalworking have thus far been identified as respiratory allergens. Specific skin tests and inhalation challenge tests with MWFs and their ingredients are recommended if an OSD or a respiratory disease is suspected.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,kqm011 [pii]||10.1093/occmed/kqm011 [doi],NLM,09627480

For this reason skin testing may not be included in a workup of wheezing infants. OBJECTIVE/METHOD: In order to evaluate the degree and evolution of skin sensitization to allergens in infants with asthma, we have retrospectively analyzed the skin test results from 40 referred asthmatic children less than 36 months of age, who had had more than three wheezing episodes and whose symptoms improved on treatment with beta-agonist and anti-inflammatory agents. RESULTS: Skin sensitization (epicutaneous) to common indoor and outdoor aeroallergens and foods were demonstrated in 23 (58%) of these patients. Asthmatic children with the onset before 12 months of age and duration of less than 12 months were sensitive predominantly to foods. Those with later onset asthmas and longer duration developed sensitivity first to indoor and then to outdoor allergens. The most common food, indoor, and outdoor allergens were egg, dust mite, and pollens, respectively. Six of these patients had repeat skin tests later. Two demonstrated a decrease in skin sensitivities to foods, one gained a new sensitivity to grass, while three remained unsensitized. CONCLUSION: Skin sensitization to allergens was common in selected asthmatic infants and evolves in the order of exposures: foods, indoor allergens, and outdoor allergens.

Exacerbations are acute events involving the worsening of asthma's primary respiratory symptoms and are a major cause of morbidity in asthma patients, largely due to the unpredictability of their onset. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in acoustic features of inhaler inhalations and changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) that occur during a simulated exacerbation, a bronchial challenge test (BCT). This is a clinical test that simulates an asthma exacerbation through the administration of a bronchoconstrictor agent. Eight patients indicated for a BCT were recruited for this study. Non-contact and tracheal microphones were employed to record Diskus inhaler inhalations throughout the course of a BCT. A spirometer was employed to measure inhaler peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR). In patients responsive to the BCT (n=4), significant correlations between changes in FEV1 and acoustic features on both microphones existed, with fractal increment of Katz fractal dimension yielding the strongest correlation (R=0.58), and between FEV1 and PIFR (R=0.62). These findings suggest that inhaler inhalation acoustic features may assist in the early detection of exacerbations. Future research will determine whether this is the case in a larger cohort of patients with non-simulated exacerbations.",Journal Article,,10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591543 [doi],NLM,26940604

We hypothesized that disadvantaged urban populations experience acute and chronic housing stressors which produce psychological stress and impact health through biological and behavioral pathways. We examined eight outcomes: six child respiratory outcomes as well as parent and child general health, using data from 682 low-income, Chicago parents of diagnosed and undiagnosed asthmatic children. We created a continuous exposure, representing material, social and emotional dimensions of housing stressors, weighted by their parent-reported difficulty. We compared the 75th to the 25th quartile of exposure in adjusted binomial and negative binomial regression models. Higher risks and rates of poor health were associated with higher housing stressors for six of eight outcomes. The risk difference (RD) for poor/fair general health was larger for children [RD = 6.28 (95% CI 1.22, 11.35)] than for parents [RD = 3.88 (95% CI -1.87, 9.63)]. The incidence rate difference (IRD) for exercise intolerance was nearly one extra day per 2 weeks for the higher exposure group [IRD = 0.88 (95% CI 0.41, 1.35)]; nearly one-third extra day per 2 weeks for waking at night [IRD = 0.32 (95% CI 0.01, 0.63)]; and nearly one-third extra day per 6 months for unplanned medical visits [IRD = 0.30 (95% CI 0.059, 0.54)]. Results contribute to the conceptualization of urban stress as a ""social pollutant"" and to the hypothesized role of stress in health disparities. Interventions to improve asthma outcomes must address individuals' reactions to stress while we seek structural solutions to residential stressors and health inequities.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,9465 [pii]||10.1007/s11524-010-9465-1 [doi],NLM,14682869

The in vivo airway resistance was determined using the modified Konzett-Rossler method. Inhalation of 0.01% of Ba598Br had an inhibitory effect against acetyl-choline (ACh, 10 micrograms/kg i.v.)-evoked bronchoconstriction. The effect of Ba598Br was more powerful and longer lasting than that of the same dose of atropine. Pretreatment with Ba598Br (0.3%) and atropine (0.3%) by inhalation produced a remarkable inhibitory effect on the asthmatic bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of Ascaris suum antigen in naturally sensitized dogs. In this case, Ba598Br showed a potency of approx. twice that of atropine as estimated from the inhibitory percent. On the other hand, in the case of posttreatment (drugs being inhaled after the antigen inhalation), both drugs showed inhibitory effects of equal degree. As for the effects on increased airway secretion at the time of asthmatic attack, both drugs inhibited the excessive secretions without any remarkable change in the viscosity of the secretions. Inhalation of 0.3% Ba598Br showed a powerful antihistamine action with respect to histamine (Hist, 3 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced bronchoconstriction after the bilateral cervical vagi and superior laryngeal nerves were amputated. However, almost no effect could be observed with the same dose of atropine. Both Ba598Br and atropine showed relaxing actions of the same degree against ACh contraction on the isolated canine trachea, bronchus and bronchiole preparations, with a particularly strong relaxation being observed in the bronchiole. On the other hand, Ba598Br showed relaxing actions against histamine-induced contractions, which were more powerful than those of atropine, in the bronchus and bronchiole. From the above findings, it is suggested that the Ba598Br inhalation brings about antiasthmatic effects by its persistent, powerful anticholinergic actions and its transient but powerful antihistamine actions.",Journal Article,,10.1254/jjp.33.971 [doi],NLM,00215198

The ratio of forced expired volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV1.0%) was significantly increased in protocols B and C (P < 0.01). The ratio of forced vital capacity to the predicted normal value (%FVC) was not changed in any of the three protocols. A significant increase in peak flow was observed in protocols B and C (P < 0.05). The maximal expiratory flow at 25% (V25) was not changed in any of the three protocols. PaO2 was significantly increased and PacO2 was significantly decreased in protocol B (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), whereas only PaCO2 was significantly decreased in protocol C (P < 0.05).

As a consequence of this a large part of population is affected and the disease has a significant burden to the society. Evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness can be determined by measuring the quality of life. OBJECTIVE: As asthma has a major impact on the patients everyday life, we examined the quality of life of adult asthmatics with a disease specific questionniare (St. George's Respiratory questionniare SGRQ) and a visual analogue scale (VAS). We wanted to find out if the quality of life scores are significant with the results of clinical tests. METHODS: We examined 321 adult asthmatic patients. Patients were randomly selected. The influence of three factors age, sex, and FEV1 on quality of life was investigated. The data was analysed with user SPSS system. RESULTS: The results of the visuala analog scale were the following in female asthmatics 61.38%, in males 63.86%, the VAS results were the following according to the disease severity: mild intermittant 76%, mild 69%, moderate 60%, sever 49%. From the St. George questionniare three component scores were calculated: symptom (304.15 +/- 11.01), activity (580.71 +/- 19.57), impact (842.18 +/- 31.53) and the total score (1727.05 +/- 57.24). When we examined the different scores according to the age we found significant differences with the activity, impact and total score, but could not find significant differences with the symptom scores. The relationship between spirometry and quality of life is not as strong (coefficient of correlation: 0.37) but the majority of patients have high SGRQ scores even those patients whose FEV1 lies within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with asthma it is common that one might see improvement in the FEV1 and yet not see an improvement in patients feelings or functioning. It was interesting to see that in spite of their bad conditions patients do accept the chronic nature of asthma, a degree of impairment and regard that as normal, limits in their everyday life, as they adjust their activity so that they can avoid the asthma attacks.",English Abstract||Journal Article,,,NLM,00016659

Dogs given 0.2% histamine solution or ascaris antigen (3 mg protein) by inhalation showed increases in respiratory resistance (Rrs) and respiratory rate to 2.5-5.0 fold. Airway secretion volume was also significantly increased 3-4 fold. The increase in Rrs by histamine inhalation was effectively inhibited or abolished by a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, chlorpheniramine (0.3-1 mg/kg i.v.), but not by a H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine (1-3 mg/kg i.v.). The increase in Rrs by antigen inhalation was reduced by relatively high doses of chlorpheniramine (1-3 mg/kg i.v.), and not by cimetidine. In contrast, hypersecretion of tracheobronchial fluid in both asthmas was significantly prevented by either chlorpheniramine or cimetidine. Combinations of both antagonists abolished the hypersecretion. Atropine (2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly inhibited the occurrence of responses in both asthmas. The results suggest that histamine is involved in the allergic asthma produced by ascaris suum and that histamine directly evokes airway constriction through H1-receptors and hypersecretion of tracheobronchial fluid through H1- and H2-receptors, and, in part, indirectly activates the cholinergic pathway.",Journal Article,,10.1254/jjp.27.791 [doi],NLM,00215198

The serial study demonstrated in the same patient, variations larger than 2 standard deviations in 25,8% of the assays for C3, 25,0% for C4 and 27,2% for C3PA, what may possibly indicate the great instability of the complement system which depends on a function, consumption or activation and synthesis relation, having to be taken into consideration in those assays comprehending the quantitative study of the seric complement fractions.",Journal Article,,,NLM,03010546

Three families have a prime importance. The Pyroglyphidae (of which Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae and Euroglyphus maynei are a part), the Acaridae and the Glyciphagidae which comprise the stock acariens responsible for certain occupational asthmas. After the discovery of the role of mites in respiratory allergy numerous studies have specified the ecological conditions favourable to their development (temperature, relative humidity, the nutritional environment) and have emphasised the beneficial role of altitude and the importance of the characteristics of the habitat. Another avenue of research consists in culture of the acariens, to isolate by immunological chemical purification techniques the glycoproteins responsible to their allergic activity, The studies led to the identification of the major allergens most frequently responsible for sensitizing man. Thus for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus two major allergens have been identified by different teams. Certain common allergens in different species explain the crossed sensitivity which are frequently observed. One of the major allergens of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, the allergen P, is contained in faecal particles of the acariens. These particles are identified in the domestic environment and are easily made into a suspension by normal household activities. Current preventative methods are orientated towards the effect of exclusion of the acariens on the respiratory symptomatology. The diminution of the mite numbers, a reduced frequency of crisis after complete eviction of the allergens from the home and diminished bronchial reactivity to pharmacological mediators after very prolonged eviction. The use of acaricides or of fungicides would merit more numerous controlled studies with a view to showing their efficacy on the respiratory symptomatology of sensitive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",English Abstract||Journal Article,,,NLM,07618425

Of these three entities, work-aggravated asthma has been recently identified to be important in worker health, but little is known about its impact on worker health. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, it is our intent to summarize the different 'types' of work-related asthma and to emphasize what is known about the outcomes of these three types, with emphasis on work-aggravated asthma. Although data is scanty, compared to occupational asthma and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, it appears that work-aggravated asthma may well have a very important level of impact on worker health that has not been well recognized in the past. SUMMARY: All of these entities have the potential to adversely alter the health of workers and, in many instances, require the worker to leave the job. Of these three entities, it appears that most is known about the natural history of occupational asthma. The recognition that workers must leave the workplace when this diagnosis is made is generally agreed upon. The second entity, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, is not as clearly understood, particularly when one recognizes that there appears to be a considerable difference in the prevalence of this illness when one compares prospective and retrospective reporting of the disease. Finally, work-aggravated asthma remains the least well described and has only been accepted as a part of the triad of work-related asthma in the past several years. The most appropriate clinical response to the diagnosis of this entity in workers has yet to be fully explored.",Journal Article||Review,45.0,00063198-200703000-00009 [pii]||10.1097/MCP.0b013e32802c7d0f [doi],NLM,10705287

Whilst the term will increase comprehensibility for both the lay and scientific communities, its biologic relevance must be compared and contrasted to asthma in human medicine, recognizing the limited availability of peer-reviewed equine-derived data, which are largely restricted to clinical signs, measures of airway obstruction and inflammation and response to therapy. Such limitations constrain meaningful comparisons with human asthma phenotypes. Suggested minimum inclusion criteria supporting the term asthma, as well as similarities and differences between IAD, RAO, and multiple human asthma phenotypes are discussed. Furthermore, differences between phenotype and severity are described, and typical features for equine asthma subcategories are proposed. Based on shared features, we conclude that mild/moderate (IAD) and severe (RAO) equine asthma are biologically appropriate models for both allergic and non-allergic human asthma, with RAO (severe equine asthma) also being an appropriate model for late-onset asthma. With the development of new biologic treatments in humans and the application of more targeted therapeutic approaches in the horse, it would appear appropriate to further investigate the allergic (Th-2) and non-allergic (non-Th-2) phenotypes of equine asthma. Further research is required to more fully determine the potential clinical utility of phenotype classification.",Journal Article||Review,,JVIM15302 [pii]||10.1111/jvim.15302 [doi],NLM,19391676

Whilst a positive diagnosis raises few problems, the aetiological diagnosis is difficult and involves two stages: recognition of the occupational characteristic of the asthma and attribution of this asthma to an allergen or substance in the occupational environment.

The other scenario, less commonly, bronchospasm is caused predominantly by causing an acute exacerbation or type II changes from 3 to 6 hours. In this chapter some recommendations about the treatment of patients in crisis and emphasizes the steps to be taken in different scenarios.",English Abstract||Journal Article||Review,,,NLM,00025151

We aimed to identify and weight risk factors for asthma attacks in children (5-12 years) in order to inform and prioritise care. METHODS: We systematically searched six databases (May 2016; updated with forward citations January 2017) with no language/date restrictions. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Weighting was undertaken by an Expert Panel who independently assessed each variable for degree of risk and confidence in the assessment (based on study quality and size, effect sizes, biological plausibility and consistency of results) and then achieved consensus by discussion. Assessments were finally presented, discussed and agreed at a multidisciplinary workshop. RESULTS: From 16 109 records, we included 68 papers (28 cohort; 4 case-control; 36 cross-sectional studies). Previous asthma attacks were associated with greatly increased risk of attack (ORs between 2.0 and 4.1). Persistent symptoms (ORs between 1.4 and 7.8) and poor access to care (ORs between 1.2 and 2.3) were associated with moderately/greatly increased risk. A moderately increased risk was associated with suboptimal drug regimen, comorbid atopic/allergic disease, African-American ethnicity (USA), poverty and vitamin D deficiency. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure, younger age, obesity and low parental education were associated with slightly increased risk. DISCUSSION: Assessment of the clinical and demographic features identified in this review may help clinicians to focus risk reduction management on the high-risk child. Population level factors may be used by health service planners and policymakers to target healthcare initiatives.

Adolescence, with its peculiarities and characteristic psychological and physical changes affects the clinical expression of asthma and above all requires particular diagnostic and therapeutic attention from the treating paediatrician. The physician should act as a direct, credible interlocutor of the adolescent. Regular sporting activity appropriate to the subject's age and asthmatic condition, and under close medical supervision, must be recommended in the asthmatic adolescent. Bronchial asthma in adolescence often presents as asthma due to physical effort. The onset of asthma must not represent an impediment to regular physical activity; adequate management strategies are however necessary (so as to prevent the symptom occurring after effort). These strategies range from the choice of type of training (environment and work loads) to pharmacological prevention measures. The asthmatic adolescent may also perform physical activity at competitive level although in this case special attention must be paid to the choice of drugs so as to avoid running into problems of disqualification due to doping.",English Abstract||Journal Article,,,NLM,00264946

Persistent inflammation of the airways is the main factor responsible for obstruction. There are no symptoms that distinguish this form of asthma from non-asthmatic chronic obstructive lung disease, and only respiratory function tests can confirm the diagnosis of CAO. Pharmacological tests with bronchodilators evaluate the bronchomotor part of CAO which is substantial in asthma as opposed to other causes of obstructive lung diseases. A negative test cannot exclude the diagnosis and suggests that the obstructive component due to bronchial inflammation is predominant. In such case a reversibility test performed with corticosteroids is of considerable interest as it reduces the partly reversible inflammatory part of the obstruction. Peak flow curves provide more precise date on the evolutive type of CAO and therefore contribute to a great extent to the monitoring and education of patients. Severe chronic asthma with high annual systemic corticosteroid consumption requires special care and justifies the current attempts made to replace corticosteroids by other anti-inflammatory drugs.",English Abstract||Journal Article||Review,12.0,,NLM,00352640

However, asthma guidelines are rarely completely up-to-date because our knowledge about the pathophysiology and treatment of asthma is continually evolving. Guidelines are an increasingly familiar part of clinical practice and may have potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of guidelines can be minimized if they are rigorously developed using evidence-based medicine. Guidelines should identify key decisions and their consequences and should review the consequences of alternative decisions. In addition, guidelines should be simple, user-friendly and widely disseminated. Guidelines evolve over time and their recommendations should be supported by evidence from clinical trials. Evidence-based medicine is the new paradigm but the results and reaction to the recent meta-analysis on house-dust mite control measures highlights the need for care when incorporating such information into guidelines. Newer therapeutic agents such as the leukotriene receptor antagonists are included in the most recent revision of the GINA guidelines, but their position in asthma therapy is not yet fully established. In countries where asthma guidelines have been implemented, there appears to have been a reduction in the prevalence of moderate persistent asthma but no decrease in severe asthma.

The diagnosis of asthma in patients over sixty years of age, becomes more complex, since there are coexistent diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, along with the difficulty for the performance of function pulmonary tests, which impact upon the adequate treatment and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To spread and update information on the clinical usefulness of elderly asmathic patients. METHODS: We performed a search for Spanish and English articles, in indexed journals from medical databases. In these papers we looked up the words: geriatrics, asthma, aging, immunosenescence, and we chose those papers with clinical relevance. RESULTS: Of the information obtained from the selected 54 articles, we observed that the elderly asthmatic patients, usually do not have a prompt diagnosis and treatment from the health services, therefore affecting their quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A better knowledge about asthma in the elderly is required, in order to improve their clinical status and quality of life, resulting in better outcomes.",English Abstract||Journal Article||Review,,,NLM,00025151

A phenotype is defined as a group of patients that present similar clinically observable characteristics, without establishing a direct etiologic relationship with a distinct pathophysiologic mechanism. An endotype, on the other hand, describes a subgroup that shares the same pathophysiologic processes that lead to the development, the progression and the presentation of a disease. A biomarker has been defined as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Several inflammatory phenotypes have been identified by the use of biomarkers. Most of them are based on the predominant type of cells in different biological fluids with sputum to be remained the most representative one. Eosinophilia represents the major characteristic of what we called classic atopic asthma. This particular phenotype usually responds well to corticosteroids, except for a small subgroup of severe asthma where even in the presence of eosinophils the ICS seem to have a less responsive role. Neutrophilic phenotype driven by the presence of neutrophils shows inadequate response to corticosteroid treatment, even in mild asthma. The major approach in order to define an endotype is driven by three main parameters. The statistical clustering approach, use of advanced statistical mathematics to create distinct patient clusters, the specific targeted immune therapies and finally the application of omics' approach. Both phenotypes and endotypes are trying to clarify mechanisms and processes that driven the complexity of asthma.

This article provides information on how to recognize patients with asthma and discuss issues related to diagnosis, treatment, and continued management within the context of current guidelines. METHODS: A literature review was conducted and relevant sources are referenced concerning the epidemiology of asthma, the pathophysiology of asthma, diagnostic strategies, treatment options, and continued management. RESULTS: Asthma is a common condition worldwide and is often associated with other atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and eczema, though other genetic and environmental factors appear to be important as well. The lower airway and upper airways share similar histology, as well as patterns of inflammation in response to environmental triggers. The diagnosis of asthma involves a careful history and a complete physical exam, including auscultation of the lungs and pulmonary function testing. Pharmacotherapy represents the primary method of treating asthma, though current evidence supports a positive role for antigen-specific immunotherapy for both prevention and treatment. Guidelines are available that can assist the otolaryngologist in classifying the severity of asthma, determining the level of control and recommending modifications in the treatment plan. CONCLUSION: As airway specialists, otolaryngologists are in a unique position to recognize and manage asthma in their patients, particularly those with allergic disease. Maintaining a high index of suspicion and understanding the key elements of diagnosis and treatment are extremely important in order to achieve this goal.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1002/alr.21386 [doi],NLM,20426984

This classification scheme groups patients into one of four categories (intermittent, mild-persistent, moderate-persistent, and severe-persistent). However, it is important to recognise that asthma severity includes both severity of the underlying disease and responsiveness to treatment. In addition, severity is not an unvarying feature in any individual asthma patient and disease severity may change over months or years. Thus, for ongoing asthma management, classification using the level of control may be more relevant and useful in clinical practice. The new version of the GINA guidelines 2006 recognises these limitations of severity assessment and classifies the condition according to the level of control as ""controlled"", ""partly controlled"", and ""uncontrolled"" asthma on the basis of daytime symptoms, restrictions of physical activity, nocturnal symptoms/awakening, need for reliever/rescue medication, lung function (PEF or FEV1) and the frequency of exacerbations. In addition, the patient is assigned to one of five treatment ""steps"". Each step represents treatment options that are alternatives for controlling asthma. Moreover, steps 1 to 5 provide options of increasing efficacy. In order to maintain asthma control regular monitoring and adjustment is essential. In cases where asthma is not or only partially controlled with the current treatment regimen, step-up treatment is recommended whereas disease control allows a gradual stepping-down to the lowest possible dose of medication necessary to maintain control. This novel asthma management approach based on disease control, may facilitate acceptance and use of asthma guidelines in clinical practice.",English Abstract||Journal Article,,10.1055/s-2007-959180 [doi],NLM,14388790

The eliciting factors, natural history, underlying molecular biology, and clinical management of asthma vary highly among affected subjects. Because of this variation, many efforts have gone into subtyping asthma. Endotypes are subtypes of disease based on distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms. Endotypes can be clinically useful because they organize our mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous diseases and can direct treatment toward modalities that are likely to be the most effective. Asthma endotyping can be shaped by clinical features, laboratory parameters, and/or -omics approaches. We discuss the application of -omics approaches, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, to asthma endotyping. -Omics approaches have provided supporting evidence for many existing endotyping paradigms and also suggested novel ways to conceptualize asthma endotypes. Although endotypes based on single -omics approaches are relatively common, their integrated multi-omics application to asthma endotyping has been more limited thus far.

The primary aim of anti-asthmatic therapy is disease control. Several questionnaires can be used in pediatrics to assess asthma control and the Children Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is one of the most used. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the percentage of asthma control in our cohort of patients with asthma and correlate C-ACT with bronchial and nasal function tests. METHODS: We enrolled all children ages between 5 and 11 years with persistent bronchial asthma, sensitized to dust mite, and who presented to our center during an 8-month period. All the children had skin-prick tests, spirometry, measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, active anterior rhinomanometry, measurement of nasal nitric oxide level, and C-ACT. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled; 80% of these children had rhinitis. According to C-ACT, 31% of our patients had uncontrolled asthma. Nasal flow values were significantly lower in patients with uncontrolled asthma, who also had higher nasal inflammation. CONCLUSION: The disease is not controlled in a significant percentage of children with asthma. In patients with uncontrolled asthma, worse nasal flow was detected. These results supported the relationship between upper and lower airways, and highlighted the importance of performing nasal function tests in all patients with asthma, which could be useful to determine whether better control of asthma symptoms can be reached through an appropriate treatment of rhinitis.",Letter,,10.2500/aap.2019.40.4219 [doi],NLM,15396304

In the United States approximately 100,000 workers are exposed to these chemical compounds in the workplace each year and 5-10% of these workers will develop occupational asthma. There are no known reliable risk factors or biomarkers which can be used to predict which exposed worker will develop diisocyanate-occupational asthma. Diisocyanate-occupational asthma workers manifest characteristic physiologic responses after specific bronchoprovocation which correlate with pathologic changes in their airways. However, the mechanism(s) for diisocyanate-occupational asthma remains unclear. Specific IgE antibody production to diisocyanates is found in only 10-30% of these workers. Bronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage have confirmed the presence of T-lymphocytes and eosinophils in the airways of these workers suggesting that T-cell mediated immune responses are more likely to play a central role in this disease. It is essential to diagnose diisocyanate-occupational asthma as early as possible in order to prevent or reduce the significant asthma morbidity associated with continuous long term exposure to these chemicals.

Epub 2013 Aug 22.,Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,2327-6924 (Electronic) 2327-6886 (Linking),United States,"PURPOSE: Vitamin D deficiency and asthma share risk factors. Epidemiologists suggest that the U.S. prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency has increased as a result of the Westernization of culture and less time spent outdoors. Numerous studies support a patient's Vitamin D deficiency as a contributing cause to increased asthma symptoms, lower lung function levels, increased airway reactivity, and worsening asthma control. The purpose of the review article is to discuss the emerging role of Vitamin D in asthma management. DATA SOURCES: A review of original research identified through MEDLINE and CINAHL and published in English was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Research suggests promising benefits of Vitamin D supplementation in asthma patients with low (<30 ng/mL) Vitamin D levels. Evidence supports several possible mechanisms, including downregulation of allergen sensitivity and enhanced steroid responsiveness. Studies demonstrate that Vitamin D modifies airway hyperresponsiveness by minimizing airway inflammation. Ongoing studies seek to further evaluate the effects of Vitamin D supplementation on asthma and asthma morbidity. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: While there is no consensus on the use of Vitamin D as a mainstay in asthma treatment, research supports its consideration for use in asthma patients with low Vitamin D levels.

Patients with severe asthma disproportionately consume health care resources related to asthma. Severe asthma may develop over time, or shortly after onset of the disease. The genetic and environmental elements that may be most important in the development of severe disease are poorly understood, but likely include both allergic and nonallergic elements. Physiologically, these patients often have air trapping, airway collapsibility, and a high degree of methacholine hyperresponsiveness. Specific phenotypes of severe asthma are only beginning to be defined. However, describing severe asthma by age at onset (early- vs. late-onset) appears to describe two phenotypes that differ at immunologic, physiologic, epidemiologic, and pathologic levels. In particular, early-onset severe asthma is a more allergic-associated disease than late-onset severe asthma. In addition, patients with severe asthma can be defined on the basis of presence and type of inflammation. Severe asthma with persistent eosinophilia (of either early or late onset) is more symptomatic and has more near-fatal events. However, at least 50% of patients with severe asthma have very little identifiable inflammation. Thus, ""steroid resistance"" may occur at numerous levels, not all of which are caused by a lack of effect of steroids on inflammation. Treatment remains problematic, with corticosteroids remaining the most effective therapy. However, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, anti-IgE, and immunomodulatory drugs are also likely to have a place in treatment. Improving therapy in this disease will require a better understanding of the phenotypes involved.",Journal Article||Review,120.0,200409-1181PP [pii]||10.1164/rccm.200409-1181PP [doi],NLM,1073449X

The patient's history and results of simple pulmonary function tests are useful in diagnosing, staging, and managing asthma. A beta 2 agonist delivered by metered-dose inhaler (e.g., albuterol) should provide prompt relief of most exacerbations.

Recent findings have allowed a greater and deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, distinguishing two groups of patients according to the prevalent cellular population that drives the inflammatory process, and consequentially, to intervene on different cellular targets. AREAS COVERED: Currently, several biological drugs directly interfering with these pathophysiological mechanisms (namely IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17) are under investigation. Expert commentary: With the elucidation of mechanisms, new-targeted drugs have been developed. Asthma therapy is changing from a 'one size fits all' therapy to a 'precision medicine' model, where we may prescribe the most appropriate treatment for each patient. Moreover, in the near future, the possibility to act a 'sequential bio-combination therapy' can be envisaged, using different biological drugs in the same patient to act on different pathophysiological mechanisms.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1080/17476348.2016.1205490 [doi],NLM,17476356

It affects 6 to 7% of this age-group, but making the distinction between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is more difficult as patients get older. STATE OF THE ART: This difficulty is due to a number of factors: the confounding role of smoking, and also the physiological effects of ageing on the airways which renders airway obstruction more resistant to bronchodilation. Elderly asthmatics can be divided on clinical grounds into two arbitrary groups: ""ageing asthmatics"" who have had asthma since childhood or adolescence and ""late-onset asthmatics"" who may present following an infective episode. Certain features of asthma in the elderly include: poor perception of breathlessness, technical difficulties in making reliable pulmonary function measurements and the extrapulmonary manifestations (impact on quality of life). PERSPECTIVES: The therapeutic strategy is much the same as for younger asthmatics but certain aspects take on greater importance: concerns about osteoporosis with long-term corticosteroid therapy (both oral and inhaled), the risk of arrhythmias with beta-2 adrenergic drugs and the significant side-effects of theophylline justifies, in difficult cases, consideration of anticholinergic and/or anti-leukotriene therapy. CONCLUSION: Most importantly, for elderly asthmatics it is a treatment regimen that is as simple as possible and is backed up by a written self-management plan that will improve outcomes.",English Abstract||Journal Article||Review,54.0,,NLM,07618425

Our understanding of asthma and its therapy has changed markedly over the last few years, particularly with the application of molecular and cell biology and the discovery of new and more specific pharmacological tools. 2. Many inflammatory cells participate in the inflammatory process in asthma and mediate a complex mixture of mediators. Cytokines are of particular importance as mediators of chronic inflammation and the means by which cytokines amplify and perpetuate the inflammatory process is now emerging. Airway epithelial cells may be a particularly important source of cytokines and other mediators, such as nitric oxide and endothelin, and may be a major target cell for inhaled steroids, which are the most effective therapy for asthma currently available. 3. The inflammatory process in asthma results not only in bronchoconstriction, but also plasma exudation, the activation of neural mechanisms, mucus secretion. The chronic inflammation may lead to structural changes, including an increase in airway smooth muscle and fibrosis, that are essentially irreversible. There is increasing evidence that transcription factors, such as NF-kappa B, play a pivotal role in the expression of inflammatory genes in asthma and may be the major molecular target for glucocorticoids.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1046/j.1365-2125.1996.03721.x [doi],NLM,03065251

Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be.

Efforts to subclassify asthma using advanced computational methods have identified a number of different phenotypes that suggest that multiple pathobiologically driven clusters of disease exist. The main phenotypes that have been identified include (1) early-onset allergic asthma, (2) early-onset allergic moderate-to-severe remodeled asthma, (3) late-onset nonallergic eosinophilic asthma, and (4) late-onset nonallergic noneosinophilic asthma. Subgroups of these phenotypes also exist but have not been as consistently identified. Advances in our understanding of the diverse immunologic perturbations that drive airway inflammation are consistent with clinical traits associated with these phenotypes and their response to biologic therapies. This has improved the clinician's approach to characterizing asthmatic patients in the clinic. Being able to define asthma endotypes using clinical characteristics and biomarkers will move physicians toward even more personalized management of asthma and precision-based care in the future. Here we will review the most prominent phenotypes and immunologic advances that suggest these disease subtypes represent asthma endotypes.",Journal Article||Review,,S0091-6749(19)30753-5 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2019.05.031 [doi],NLM,10976825

The identification and treatment of psychopathology is included in the management of DA. Psychopathology is supposed to predispose patients to DA or vice versa; psychopathology may develop as a consequence of DA. We reviewed the available literature on empirical findings regarding psychopathology in adult patients with DA. METHODS: Studies in English language journals using MEDLINE, Cochrane and PsycINFO databases, were retrieved by an electronic search published from 1990 till July 2014. RESULTS: Literature on psychopathology in DA is scarce. The search identified 16 articles of which only 6 articles were specifically about psychopathology in adult patients with DA. Almost half of the patients with DA had evidence of psychopathology at both syndrome and symptom level. Moreover, psychopathology appeared to be related to frequent exacerbations in patients with DA. CONCLUSIONS: This literature review suggests a high prevalence of psychopathology of patients with DA, although it remains unclear whether psychopathology occurs more often in DA compared to ""stable asthma"". More research is needed on a possible role of psychopathology on clinical signs and symptoms in DA.",Journal Article,,10.3109/02770903.2014.999281 [doi],NLM,15324303

Some 300 different workplace agents are capable of inducing asthma but most cases are attributable to a far smaller number to which exposure is incurred in a few high-risk occupations.

Physicians have also to recognize early symptoms of an acute severe asthma. For the identification of the allergen(s) responsible for asthma, data obtained from clinical history, from cutaneous prick tests eventually associated to serum specific IgE antibodies have to be taken in account.

In Taiwan, the prevalence of childhood asthma has risen to around 10% in the 1990s, in contrast to a prevalence of about 1% in the 1970s. Currently, Australia and New Zealand have the highest prevalence in the world (> 15%). African and Asian countries have a low prevalence of about 5 to 10%. In general, countries in coastal, temperate and subtropical zones have the highest mite-sensitive asthma prevalence. Countries in the subarctic or in semiarid areas have a lower prevalence. Indoor allergens such as house dust mites, cockroaches and fungi usually cause perennial asthma; outdoor allergens such as grass and tree pollens as well as outdoor fungi induce seasonal asthma. A gene on chromosome 11q13 is significantly linked to maternal inheritance of asthma, and possibly involves polymorphisms in the beta subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor. Cytokine genes in chromosome 5q31-33 are known to regulate IgE production resulting in various severities of allergic diseases. Recent studies suggest that pollutants such as diesel exhaust, O3, NO2, and SO2, together with allergens and susceptible genes are likely to promote IgE production and allergic reactions. As a result, asthma is apparently not a single gene disorder, but a disease determined by the interaction between gene and environment. In practice, immunopharmacological interventions to block IgE-mediated early bronchospasm and late inflammatory reactions are the major regimens for asthma treatments. This makes possible a step-wise self-management based on portable monitoring of airway resistance using the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Early avoidance of allergen exposure in utero as well as early anti-inflammatory therapy in infancy have decreased the prevalence of allergic diseases. A combination of both strategies may bring much more benefit in the prevention of childhood asthma. As progress in therapeutic gene vaccines as well as genetic immunoregulation continues, we expect early environmental avoidance and genetic vaccines may prevent childhood asthma in the near future.",Journal Article||Review,160.0,,NLM,20720939

Currently, there is significant variation in the management of asthma exacerbations expressed in guideline recommendations versus clinical practice. This disconnect affects diagnostic and treatment decisions for the clinician and patient. OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed the available guidelines providing recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic management of asthma exacerbations in the paediatric population. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature for guidelines published between January 2009 and October 2019 was conducted, using a protocol registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO CRD42020221562). RESULTS: 16 asthma exacerbation clinical practice guidelines for children were included. Despite general agreement between guidelines on the definition of asthma exacerbation, there was great variability in the definition of disease severity and assessment of asthma control. This systematic review also highlighted a paucity of recommendations for criteria for hospitalisation and discharge. Many guidelines scored poorly when measured for stakeholder involvement and editorial independence. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive and updated guidelines compliant with international standards for clinical guidelines may significantly improve clinical practice quality, promote evidence-based recommendations and provide uniformity of treatment between countries.",Journal Article||Systematic Review,,30/161/200367 [pii]||ERR-0367-2020 [pii]||10.1183/16000617.0367-2020 [doi],NLM,16000617

A significant challenge in the diagnosis and management of severe asthma is the ability to identify accurately the patients most at risk for adverse outcomes, such as medication side effects, emergency department visits, hospitalization, near-fatal events, or disability from persistent symptoms or chronic lung function abnormalities. To improve the treatment of these patients, we must improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for severe disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to develop a common definition of severe asthma to allow adequate characterization of the disease clinically and provide the opportunity to compare results from many studies. Several severe asthma phenotypes have been described in the literature on the basis of the age of patients, age of disease onset, corticosteroid resistance, chronic airflow obstruction, and evidence for eosinophilic airway inflammation on biopsy. These phenotypes have led to an emerging interest in the use of noninvasive methods to monitor airway inflammation in severe asthma.

Epidemiological studies showed that the mortality rate of asthma in children is still high worldwide. Asthma control is therefore essential to minimize asthma exacerbations, which can be fatal if the condition is poorly controlled. Frequent monitoring could help to detect asthma progression and ensure treatment effectiveness. Although subjective asthma monitoring tools are available, the results vary as they rely on patients' self-perception. Emerging evidence suggests several objective tools could have the potential for monitoring purposes. However, there is no consensus to standardise the use of objective monitoring tools. In this review, we start with the prevalence and severity of childhood asthma worldwide. Then, we detail the latest available objective monitoring tools, focusing on their effectiveness in paediatric asthma management. Publications of spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), hyperresponsiveness tests and electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) between 2016 and 2023 were included. The potential advantages and limitations of each tool were also discussed.

Perception of asthma control has varied widely among patients as well as healthcare providers. Several clinical markers have been developed to define and standardize the measurement of asthma control. They are based primarily on patients' symptoms and have been popular in clinical practice and in clinical studies. With the advances in basic research on the pathology of asthma, several biological markers have evolved that have the advantages of being objective, quantitative and more reflective of the underlying pathology, which makes them a better guide for selecting optimal therapy. In addition to the cost and expertise required, biological makers are influenced by multiple factors that limit their application in clinical practice.

Predicting an individual patient's response to asthma drugs remains challenging, and the provision of personalized treatment remains elusive. Although biomarkers, such as allergic sensitization and blood eosinophilia, might be important predictors of response to inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children, these relatively cheap and available investigations are seldom used in clinical practice to select patients for corticosteroid prescription. However, for the majority of patients, response to different treatments cannot be accurately predicted. One of the key factors preventing further advances is the reductionist view of asthma as a single disease, which is forcing patients with different asthma subtypes into a single group for empiric treatment. This inevitably results in treatment failures and, for some, an unacceptable risk/benefit ratio. The approach to asthma today is an example of the traditional symptom (diagnosis)-based, one-size-fits-all approach rather than a stratified approach, and our guidelines-driven management based on a unitary diagnosis might not be the optimal way to deliver care. The only way to deliver stratified medicine and find a cure is through the understanding of asthma endotypes. We propose that the way to discover endotypes, biomarkers, and personalized treatments is through the iterative process based on interpretation of big data analytics from birth and patient cohorts, responses to treatments in randomized controlled trials, and in vitro mechanistic studies using human samples and experimental animal models, with technological and methodological advances at its core.",Journal Article||Review,,S0091-6749(19)30686-4 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2019.05.016 [doi],NLM,10976825

TLRs are localized as integral membrane or intracellular glycoproteins with those on the cell surface sensing microbial antigens and the ones, localized in intracellular vesicles, sensing microbial nucleic acid species. Having recognized microbial antigens, TLRs conduct the immune response towards a pro- or anti-allergy response.

Management of pediatric asthma requires an understanding of the issues that uniquely effect children. This review provides the reader with the current state and future directions of pediatric asthma. METHODS: Review of the pediatric asthma literature was undertaken with emphasis on randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. RESULTS: The prevalence of pediatric asthma remains elevated and is increasingly being appreciated in select global regions. Effective treatment in any setting begins with a focused medical history that queries key asthma features that inform both diagnostic and monitoring strategies. A thorough medical history may yield comorbid upper airway disorders and allergic triggers that could potentially exacerbate airway inflammation. Pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator lung function testing is a preferable diagnostic strategy to quantitatively assess obstructive pulmonary disease among children capable of performing the testing maneuvers. Pediatric asthmatics who continue to have poor disease control require monitoring of medication adherence and drug delivery techniques, because both are often linked with disease outcomes. Therapeutic strategies in children are notably distinct from adults due to the possible effects of inhaled corticosteroids on reduced bone mineral density and growth. Adolescents may also require more time to address the psychosocial complexities that may complicate the required daily usage of asthma medicines.

There are important age-related physiologic and immunologic changes that complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and management of asthma in the aged population. Evidence suggests that elderly asthmatics are more likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Additionally, elderly patients with asthma have highest rates of morbidity and mortality from their disease than younger patients. The underlying airway inflammation of asthma in this age group likely differs from younger patients and is felt to be non-type 2 mediated. While elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, subgroup analysis of large clinical trials suggests they may be less likely to respond to traditional asthma therapies (ie, corticosteroids). As the armamentarium of pharmacologic asthma therapies expands, it will be critical to include elderly asthmatics in large clinical trials so that therapy may be better tailored to this at-risk and growing population.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1111/all.13258 [doi],NLM,13989995

We included 205 asthmatic patients divided, according to skin-prick tests, in a group (n = 63) of IA and a group (n = 142) of EA. The questionnaire provided information on associated conditions (nasal polyps and intolerance to aspirin) as well as on allergenic and nonallergenic triggers. Data analysis demonstrated that in IA, some airborne nonallergenic factors were significantly more often involved. In addition, this association did hold true when comparing subgroups of patients with normal baseline FEV1 values. For those subjects, PC20 and the slopes of the dose-response curves to metacholine were comparable. In conclusion, the higher sensitivity of a group IA subjects to some nonallergenic factors is not related to a lower baseline spirometric value in this subgroup.

If control remains poor after diagnostic confirmation, detailed assessments of the reasons for asthma being difficult-to-control are needed. Underlying modifiable factors including non-adherence to medication, persistent environmental exposures that trigger asthma symptoms and psychosocial factors contribute to poor control in these patients. AREAS COVERED: The focus of this review is to provide a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of difficult asthma including an overview of long term assessments to identify potential progression to true, severe asthma. A multi-disciplinary team is critical to enable modifiable factors to be identified and addressed. Significant resources are required to manage paediatric difficult asthma optimally and only specialist centres should be tasked with the assessment of these patients. Although this may have an impact on healthcare resources, long term benefits for lung health are significant. Expert commentary: The management of paediatric difficult asthma is not simple and involves numerous professionals with varied expertise. However, if it is not undertaken with the appropriate skills, there is a significant risk of children receiving inappropriate invasive investigations and therapies that will have no impact on morbidity.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1080/17476348.2016.1191355 [doi],NLM,17476356

At the end of this period devoted to diagnosis a systematic approach is set up to take care of these patients. Therapeutic education includes action plans and measures for triggering factors avoidance in order to prevent exacerbations. Comorbidities such as rhinitis, nasal polyposis, gastro-oesophageal reflux and obesity are taken into account.

Clinical signs range from intermittent wheezing and coughing, which can compromise quality of life, to episodes of severe dyspnea that can be life-threatening. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Feline asthma can be easily disregarded as a simplistic condition. However, much about its pathophysiology remains obscure. There is no gold standard method of diagnosis, and current approaches are associated with various limitations. Also, feline asthma is typically treated with long-term glucocorticoid therapy, which can have significant consequences. AUDIENCE: Because of its prevalence, general practitioners encounter asthma regularly. Refractory cases are often managed by veterinary internists and pulmonologists. PATIENT GROUP: Asthma can be diagnosed in cats of any age but is usually seen in young to middle-aged adults (mean 4 years, range 1-15 years). There is no sex predilection, but the Siamese breed appears to be overrepresented. EVIDENCE BASE: While the standard clinical approach to feline asthma has changed little in recent years, new research has provided greater insight into many aspects of this complex disease and new strategies are being studied. This article reviews the current literature in order to raise awareness of how advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of feline asthma may be determining the future direction of clinical practice.",Journal Article||Review,,S1098-612X(10)00233-0 [pii]||10.1016/j.jfms.2010.07.012 [doi],NLM,15322750

This year's summary will focus on recent advances in pediatric asthma on modifying disease activity, preventing asthma exacerbations, managing severe asthma, and risk factors for predicting and managing early asthma, as indicated in Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology publications in 2012. Recent reports continue to shed light on methods to improve asthma management through steps to assess disease activity, tools to standardize outcome measures in asthma, genetic markers that predict risk for asthma and appropriate treatment, and interventions that alter the early presentation of asthma to prevent progression. We are well on our way to creating a pathway around wellness in asthma care and also to use new tools to predict the risk for asthma and take steps to not only prevent asthma exacerbations but also to prevent the early manifestations of the disease and thus prevent its evolution to severe asthma.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",,S0091-6749(12)01789-7 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2012.11.009 [doi],NLM,10976825

The heterogeneous nature of the clinical manifestations and therapeutic responses of asthma in both adult and pediatric patients indicate that it may be more of a syndrome rather than a specific disease entity. Numerous triggering factors including viral infections, allergen and irritant exposure, and exercise, among others, complicate both the acute and chronic treatment of asthma. Therapeutic intervention has focused on the appreciation that airway obstruction in asthma is composed of both bronchial smooth muscle spasm and variable degrees of airway inflammation characterized by edema, mucus secretion, and the influx of a variety of inflammatory cells. The presence of only partial reversibility of airflow obstruction in some patients indicates that structural remodeling of the airways may also occur over time. Choosing appropriate medications depends on the disease severity (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, severe persistent), extent of reversibility, both acutely and chronically, patterns of disease activity (exacerbations related to viruses, allergens, exercise, etc), and the age of onset (infancy, childhood, adulthood).","Journal Article||Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.||Review",,S0091674902913564 [pii]||S0091-6749(02)91356-4 [pii]||10.1067/mai.2003.94 [doi],NLM,00916749

RECENT FINDINGS: Asthma is a heterogeneous set of lung pathologies with overlapping features. Human studies and animal models suggest that exposure to different environmental adjuvants activate distinct immune pathways, which in turn give rise to distinct forms, or endotypes, of allergic asthma. Depending on their concentrations, inhaled TLR ligands can activate either type 2 inflammation, or Th17 differentiation, along with regulatory responses that function to attenuate inflammation. By contrast, a different category of environmental adjuvants, proteases, activate distinct immune pathways and prime predominantly type 2 immune responses. Asthma is not a single disease, but rather a group of pathologies with overlapping features. Different endotypes of asthma likely arise from perturbations of distinct immunologic pathways during allergic sensitization.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural||Review",,10.1007/s11882-020-00935-3 [pii]||10.1007/s11882-020-00935-3 [doi],NLM,15346315

This past year, we have learned that early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids in childhood asthma reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Theme issues over the last year focused attention on severe asthma and black box warnings. Both of these themes significantly affect the management of childhood asthma. Responsiveness to asthma treatment is heterogeneous even among patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing control and adjusting treatment accordingly. We are now moving toward an individualized approach to asthma therapy and searching for biomarkers and genetics as a resource to guide treatment. To improve asthma control, we must continue to obtain information on early asthma, severe asthma, asthma exacerbations, and methods to improve asthma control. Evaluation and management of severe asthma in children include verification of the diagnosis, assessment for coexisting illnesses, and identification of effective treatment strategies directed to adherence, medication delivery, and combination therapy. Application of biomarkers and genetics could be useful tools in individualizing our approach to the management of childhood asthma.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural||Review",39.0,S0091-6749(06)03811-5 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2006.12.619 [doi],NLM,00916749

Asthma is caused by a complex interaction between genes and environmental exposures; early-life exposures in particular play an important role. Asthma is also heritable, and a number of susceptibility variants have been discovered in genome-wide association studies, although the known risk alleles explain only a small proportion of the heritability. In this review, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that focusing on more specific asthma phenotypes, such as childhood asthma with severe exacerbations, and on relevant exposures that are involved in gene-environment interactions (GEIs), such as rhinovirus infections, will improve detection of asthma genes and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We will discuss the challenges of considering GEIs and the advantages of studying responses to asthma-associated exposures in clinical birth cohorts, as well as in cell models of GEIs, to dissect the context-specific nature of genotypic risks, to prioritize variants in genome-wide association studies, and to identify pathways involved in pathogenesis in subgroups of patients. We propose that such approaches, in spite of their many challenges, present great opportunities for better understanding of asthma pathogenesis and heterogeneity and, ultimately, for improving prevention and treatment of disease.","Journal Article||Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",,S0091-6749(16)00127-5 [pii]||10.1016/j.jaci.2016.01.006 [doi],NLM,10976825

It is then important in patients with suspected difficult asthma to ensure that the diagnosis is correct, and that if the patient has asthma that the attributed symptoms are indeed all genuinely due to the asthma and not to coexisting physical or psychogenic respiratory conditions. It is also important to be alert when there is discordance between symptoms and objective lung function in order to recognize both poor perceivers and over-reactors. Difficult asthma can occur in patients with objectively mild, moderate or severe disease, but the consequences are most dramatic in patients with severe asthma. Asthma may be difficult for the patient, for the clinician or both because of disease factors, doctor or nurse therapist factors, and/or patient factors. Investigation requires access to the full range of respiratory, imaging and allergy tests. It also requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ear, nose and throat specialists and speech therapists, and access to psychiatric and psychological assessment and therapies. Poor compliance is associated with significantly poorer asthma and asthma-related health outcomes. Poor compliance can be recognized in two-thirds of such patients by their not attending scheduled appointments. Poor compliance is significantly associated with anxiety, social deprivation and adverse family circumstances, and these characteristics and adversities probably contribute to the poorly compliant behaviour. In difficult asthma it is important to identify and manage the condition causing the symptoms rather than prescribing more and more asthma therapy. Recognizing psychosocial adversity is essential. A structured approach is essential. There remains a small number of patients with genuine steroid-resistant asthma, some with predominately neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic airway inflammation, and others for whom the secondary gain of continuing symptoms is overwhelming. There is a need for further research using agreed definitions, structured approaches and a full range of investigations in patients with difficult asthma.",Journal Article||Review,26.0,IMJ901 [pii]||10.1111/j.1445-5994.2005.00901.x [doi],NLM,14440903

AIM: To update the South African paediatric acute asthma guidelines according to current evidence, and produce separate recommendations for children above and below 2 years of age. METHODS: A working group of the South African Childhood Asthma Group was established to review the published literature on acute asthma in children from 2000 to 2012, and to revise the South African guidelines accordingly. RECOMMENDATIONS: Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators remain the first-line treatment of acute asthma. A metered-dose inhaler with spacer is preferable to nebulisation for bronchodilator therapy to treat mild to moderate asthma. Two to four puffs of a short-acting bronchodilator given every 20 - 30 minutes, depending on clinical response, should be given for mild attacks; up to 10 puffs may be needed for more severe asthma. Children with severe asthma or oxygen saturation (SpO2) <92% should receive oxygen and frequent doses of nebulised beta-2-agonists, and be referred to hospital. Nebulised ipratropium bromide (via nebulisation or multidosing via pMDI-spacer combination) should be added if there is a poor response to three doses of beta2-agonist or if the symptoms are severe. Early use of corticosteroids reduces the need for hospital admission and prevents relapse; oral therapy is preferable. Assessment of acute asthma in children below the age of 2 years can be difficult, and other causes of wheezing must be excluded. Treatment of acute asthma in this age group is similar to that of older children. CONCLUSION: Effective therapy for treatment of acute asthma - primarily inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists, oral corticosteroids and oxygen with appropriate delivery systems - should be available in all healthcare facilities and rapidly instituted for treatment of acute asthma in children. ENDORSEMENT: The guideline document was endorsed by the Allergy Society of South Africa (ALLSA), the South African Thoracic Society (SATS), the National Asthma Education Programme (NAEP), the South African Paediatric Association (SAPA) and the South African Academy of Family Practice.",Journal Article||Practice Guideline,,10.7196/samj.6658 [doi],NLM,02569574

The 2007 Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines designate severity and control, mediated by considerations of current impairment and future risk, as the primary concepts in assessing and monitoring asthma. Severity should ideally be determined at the time of diagnosis, after which control becomes the central focus of asthma management. In the area of treatment, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) remain first-line therapy for longterm asthma management in children and adults. For patients whose severity of asthma requires more than low-dose ICSs, or whose asthma cannot be well controlled on monotherapy with low-dose ICSs, evidence supports the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of an ICS plus an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) or an increase to medium-dose ICSs. For children >5 years of age and adults not controlled on low-dose ICSs, the combination of a low-dose ICS plus an inhaled LABA is equivalent in terms of outcomes to the use of medium-dose ICS. For children <5 years of age not controlled on low-dose ICSs, increasing the dose of ICSs is preferred to the addition of a LABA to low-dose ICS therapy as no studies using combination therapy have been conducted for patients in this age group. With regard to asthma prevention, approaches to primary prevention (to avoid allergen sensitization) and secondary prevention (to avoid disease progression) are still very much in the developmental stage, while tertiary prevention (to avoid asthmatic stimuli) has been more successful particularly in pediatric patients. Written action plans as part of self-management processes appear to improve physician-patient communication and disease status tracking.

The prevalence of occupational asthma (OA) ranges from 9% to 15% of the asthmatic population. Factors that might influence the development of OA include the work environment, climatic conditions, genetic proclivities, tobacco and recreational drug use, respiratory infection, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and endotoxin exposure. Pathogenetically, new-onset OA can be allergic or nonallergic in origin. The allergic variants are usually caused by high-molecular-weight allergens, such as grain dust and animal or fish protein. Selected low-molecular-weight agents are also capable of inducing allergic OA. Symptoms ensue after a latent period of months to years. Nonallergic OA can be precipitated by a brief high-level exposure to a potent irritant. Symptoms occur immediately or within a few hours of the exposure. Once the diagnosis of allergic OA is established, the worker should be removed from further exposure in the workplace.

We aimed to investigate the respective association of individual- and area-level SEP with uncontrolled asthma among French elderly women. METHODS: Analyses were conducted in the Asthma-E3N study, among participants with current asthma (i.e., asthma attacks, treatment, or symptoms in previous year). Asthma control was evaluated using Asthma Control Test (uncontrolled: score </=19); SEP was defined at both individual- and area-level, using educational level (low, medium, high), the French Deprivation index (tertiles defined at national level), and by merging them in a combined-SEP index. Associations between SEP and asthma control were estimated for 2258 women by logistic regression adjusted for age. Analyses were stratified by asthma controller medication use estimated through a drug reimbursement database. RESULTS: Women were 70 years on average and 24% had uncontrolled asthma. A low educational level (11%) was associated with an increased risk of uncontrolled asthma [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.9 (1.4,2.6)], especially among women not using controller medication [3.1 (1.9,5.1)]. Using the combined-SEP index, the highest risk of uncontrolled asthma was observed among women with the most disadvantaged socioeconomic profile (low educational level and low-SEP neighborhood) [2.5 (1.5,4.2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Women with low SEP had more often uncontrolled asthma, which might be partly explained by inadequate asthma treatment. To achieve the best management of asthma for elderly patients, a specific attention should be given not only to disadvantaged population and neighborhoods, but also to disadvantaged populations in affluent neighborhoods.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,S0954-6111(19)30297-5 [pii]||10.1016/j.rmed.2019.09.010 [doi],NLM,15323064

Accurate clinical assessment from the history and physical examination is very important to assess the severity of the disease. Some measure of airway resistance of either FEV1 or PEFR should be done in every patient initially, at repeated intervals, and at discharge, to have a parameter to follow in therapy as well as a tool to use to warn the physician of a severe amount of airway obstruction. The inhaled beta agonists are the first line of therapy in acute asthma and can be delivered by either the nebulizer or the MDI with or without a spacer. Aminophylline will be continued to be used acutely even though it appears there is no improvement in bronchospasm in the first few hours of treatment when aminophylline is added to therapy. Anticholinergic agents will gain a wider role in acute asthma, especially when used in combination with a beta agonist. Corticosteroids continue to have a role in severe attacks of asthma, and earlier use may prevent relapse. Fatal asthma still occurs, however, and the emergency physician must use strict criteria to recognize status asthmaticus or the patient who is not doing well and admit them to the hospital. Using a stepwise, logical approach to the treatment of the asthmatic patient will lead to better patient satisfaction and fewer errors on part of the emergency physician.",Journal Article||Review,61.0,,NLM,07338627

It has received wide public attention in recent years because of increasing morbidity and deaths, particularly among black persons. The important role of inflammation in the immunopathogenesis of asthma has led to a newer therapeutic approach directed at interrupting this inflammatory process. Among immune regulatory pathways involved in asthma pathogenesis, two lymphokines appear to be particularly important in controlling IgE production. Interleukin-4 is required for IgE production; without it, IgE production is inhibited. Interferon-gamma can diminish cell priming for interleukin-4 production. Thus, the interplay of these two cytokines will determine whether cells that can make interleukin-4 will be produced and, therefore, whether IgE will be produced in response to allergic stimuli. Further, in response to appropriate stimuli, mast cells and eosinophils are attracted to airways and release cytokines, lipid mediators, and preformed substances that cause inflammation. Modern asthma treatment is directed at interrupting this inflammatory process and places a much greater emphasis on use of anti-inflammatory agents, such as aerosolized or parenteral corticosteroids, and on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium. Research advances without therapeutic application, however, limit success. Projects such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study, which is directed toward underserved populations, are intended to identify more clearly the factors responsible for increasing morbidity and to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions.","Consensus Development Conference||Consensus Development Conference, NIH||Journal Article||Review",78.0,10.7326/0003-4819-121-9-199411010-00011 [doi],NLM,00034819

The history search for the presence of an atopic state, the occurrence of similar disorders in members of the same firm and also the timing of symptoms in relation to the occupational activities. Cutaneous tests are particularly helpful in IgE-mediated asthma in relation to the inhalation of animal or vegetable materials of glycoprotein origin. For haptens, the need for their prior coupling to a protein carrier causes problems which have not been entirely resolved. Laboratory tests run into the same snags. Respiratory function and non-specific bronchial provocation tests, confirm the diagnosis of asthma and enable the medium and long term prognostic to be assessed. Specific bronchial provocation tests are the most appropriate tests to establish an aetiological diagnosis in occupational asthma. Different technical methods are possible: quantitative administration of allergen aerosols, realistic tests, and tests using exposure chambers to achieve true test doses.

The contribution to incidence made by asthma of occupational origin is of the order 20-100 cases per million workers per year; the individual worker's lifetime risk approaching 5% in some industrial environments. Management of the affected industry inevitably follows different pathways from that of the affected individual, though both need to start from a definitive diagnosis. For the affected industry, managers must identify the causative agent and assess the extent of the problem. Affected workers can then be removed from hazardous settings, and meaningful strategies of prevention can be introduced. The most promising preventive measures involve improvements in industrial hygiene or the substitution of alternative agents in the manufacturing process. The role of worker selection (i.e. the exclusion of applicant workers who may be unduly susceptible because they smoke, or have existing airway hyperresponsiveness or atopy) is small and controversial. More valuable is a strict surveillance programme of workers perceived to be at risk, so that emerging disease is recognized promptly, before it poses any major threat of permanent ill-health. Management choices beyond conventional medication and the avoidance of irritant environmental triggers are greatly limited for the affected individual worker. A change of job environment with complete cessation of exposure to the relevant asthma-inducing agent is to be favoured and offers the best chance of full recovery, but may not be practical if the worker is to avoid permanent unemployment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Journal Article,,,NLM,09031936

Airway inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, epithelial sloughing, mucous hypersecretion, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucosal edema contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of asthma. Diagnostic tests such as methacholine or mannitol challenges or spirometry (pre- and postbronchodilator responses) help to identify such underlying pathophysiology via assessments of bronchial hyperreactivity and lung mechanics but are imperfect and ultimately must be viewed in the context of a patient's clinical presentation including response to pharmacotherapy.

The approach to problematic severe asthma may vary with the age of the child, but, in general, three steps need to be taken in order to separate difficult-to-treat from severe therapy-resistant asthma. First, confirmation that the problem is really due to asthma requires a complete diagnostic re-evaluation. Secondly, the paediatrician needs to systematically exclude comorbidity, as well as personal or family psychosocial disorders. The third step is to re-evaluate medication adherence, inhaler technique and the child's environment.

It makes recommendations for best practices in the management of childhood asthma, including management of acute exacerbations and non-pharmacological and pharmacological management. These guidelines will be of interest to non-specialist physicians involved in the care of children with asthma. In JPGL, JPGL2017 is the first evidence-based guidelines updated according to the GRADE system and Minds approach, and it addresses eight clinical questions about the treatment of childhood asthma. In children aged </=5 years, infant and preschool asthma is diagnosed according to the response to short acting beta2 agonists or the effect of a therapeutic trial during 1 month with controller treatment and worsening after treatment cessation. Long-term management both promotes pharmacological therapy and measures against risk factors that induce exacerbation, better patient education and a partnership with trinity. In addition, long-term management should not be carried out without review but rather be based on a cycle of evaluation, adjustment and treatment. In JPGL2017, the transdermal patch and oral beta2 agonists are positioned as drugs within the concept of ""short-term additional treatment"" to be used until the symptoms are stabilized when the control state transiently deteriorates.",Journal Article||Practice Guideline,,S1323-8930(20)30017-4 [pii]||10.1016/j.alit.2020.02.005 [doi],NLM,14401592

The concepts of ""asthma control"" and""asthma severity"" are currently evolving, although the fundamental hall-marks that define the syndrome of asthma endure and should be mastered by asthma specialists. Asthma masqueraders, including several that may confound a correct diagnosis of asthma, are important to consider when either the presentation of asthma is atypical or the response of the patient to treatment is suboptimal. COPD and VCD head the list of diagnoses most likely to be confused with asthma in everyday practice. Correctly identifying the diagnosis of COPD enables implementation of an up-to-date treatment plan that differs from asthma management. VCD is a vastly under recognized syndrome whose existence is widely accepted but whose pathophysiology is poorly understood, and correctly identifying a VCD component to asthma symptoms enables both a reduction in costly and potentially harmful asthma medications and focus on specific VCD treatment, such as speech therapy. For less common and uncommon asthma masqueraders, it is important to be familiar with their typical clinical presentation and basic diagnostic approaches.",Journal Article||Review,33.0,S0025-7125(05)00087-8 [pii]||10.1016/j.mcna.2005.08.004 [doi],NLM,00257125

DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive review of the literature using MEDLINE was conducted. STUDY SELECTION: Included articles were selected for their relevance to variability or severity of asthma. Bibliographies of selected articles served as additional sources of considered publications. RESULTS: Asthma severity can vary substantially among patients and within individual patients because of physiologic, environmental, or behavioral factors. Inhaled corticosteroids are an effective and versatile treatment option for special populations with asthma and for patients with varying degrees of asthma severity. Inhaled corticosteroids are now the preferred treatment for all three severity levels of persistent asthma, especially in young children and pregnant women. Treatment regimens may be adjusted up or adjusted down when appropriate to maintain optimal symptom control and limit potential adverse systemic effects. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical management of asthma is challenging given the day-to-day variability of the disease. Variability in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms may be minimized through increased awareness of the factors contributing to asthma variability as well as the effective use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Flexible treatment strategies that consider the different severities of asthma and account for variability within individual patients may be particularly useful in improving adherence and patient outcomes.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",106.0,,NLM,02770903

METHODS: A prospective study was performed between September 2006 and February 2007. A total of 33 patients with acute exacerbation of asthma and 13 healthy subjects were recruited into the study. The patients with acute exacerbation of asthma were also studied when they returned to the remission state. Levels of lung function, levels of C5a in induced sputum and cell differential count in induced sputum were determined. RESULTS: The level of C5a in induced sputum was significantly higher in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma [0.85(0.68-2.13) mug/L] than that in patients with stable asthma [0.45(0.26-0.88) mug/L, Z=-2.193, P=0.013]; Sputum C5a levels in stable asthma patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls [0.14(0.06-0.45) mug/L, Z=-2.141, P=0.015]. The level of C5a in patients with severe exacerbation [2.21(1.27-9.0) mug/L] was significantly higher than those in patients with mild exacerbation [0.34(0.17-0.63) mug/L] and moderate exacerbation [0.85(0.55-1.67) mug/L, chi(2) = 12.330, P=0.001]. The level of C5a in induced sputum was positively correlated with the number of total cells count (r=0.797, P=0.004), neutrophils (r=0.504, P=0.032) and macrophages (r=0.424, P=0.036) in acute exacerbation of asthma.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although prevalence estimates varied considerably among six recent epidemiologic studies, collectively they contribute to the conclusion that work-exacerbated asthma is common. Median work-exacerbated asthma prevalence estimates were 18% of adults with asthma, 25% of working adults with asthma and 45% of all work-related asthma cases. Work-exacerbated asthma can result from a variety of occupational triggers, including physical factors (e.g. extreme temperatures, exercise), behavioral states (e.g. strong emotions, stress), odors (e.g. perfume), general irritants and dust, and second-hand cigarette smoke. Work-exacerbated asthma cases have many of the same demographic and clinical traits as other adults with asthma and occupational asthma cases, although some differences have been reported. Recent review articles have offered some recommendations on the management of work-exacerbated asthma, but more comprehensive advice is anticipated from a professional medical society in the next few years. SUMMARY: Epidemiologic studies indicate that work-exacerbated asthma is common. Researchers have started to pay attention to work-exacerbated asthma, but more studies are needed on all aspects of this condition in order to improve diagnosis, management and prevention.",Journal Article||Review,21.0,00130832-200704000-00005 [pii]||10.1097/ACI.0b013e328054c640 [doi],NLM,15284050

While traditional views of asthma have centered around a childhood onset disease with an allergic component, several large scale network studies are now confirming that severe asthma can present in multiple different ways, only 30-50% of which meet traditional childhood onset allergic criteria. To understand the different groups better, initial studies have attempted to define phenotypes of severe asthma. A phenotype is defined as the integration of different characteristics that are the product of the interaction of the patient's genes with the environment. Both clinical and statistical approaches have identified at least 3-5 phenotypes of severe asthma. However, these phenotypes, in isolation, do not identify the immunopathology that makes these clinical phenotypes distinct or identifies a target population for a specific approach to therapy. As biological characteristics are identified, phenotypes should continue to evolve towards asthma endotypes. The identification of these endotypes, either by matching biology, genetics and therapeutic responses to therapy with clinically or statistically defined phenotypes or through unbiased genetic and genomic approaches, remains limited. Moving forward, this integration of genetics, biology and clinical characteristics should substantially enhance our ability to effectively treat complex heterogeneous diseases, such as severe asthma.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03929.x [doi],NLM,13652222

Respiratory function measurements and reversibility and bronchial provocation tests (except when contraindicated) are essential in the reevaluation of an asthma diagnosis. Factors that can influence asthma control, such as environmental exposures, comorbid conditions, treatment adherence, and in particular inhalation technique must be recognized and considered appropriately before confirming the diagnosis of severe asthma. Objective criteria are important in the follow-up evaluation of severe asthma. They must include the measurement of some disease components.

Therefore, there is a great need for clinically applicable tools allowing for improved patient classification, and selection for specific management approaches. Some interventions are highly helpful in selected patients (e.g., allergen immunotherapy or aspirin desensitization), but they are costly and/or difficult to implement. Currently available biomarkers measurable in peripheral blood or exhaled air display many limitations for asthma phenotyping and cannot identify properly the specific triggers of the disease (e.g., aeroallergens or NSAID). The united airway concept illustrates the relevant epidemiological and pathophysiological links between the upper and lower airways. This concept has been largely applied to patient management and treatment, but its diagnostic implications have been less often explored. Of note, a recent document by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology proposes the use of nasal allergen challenge to confirm the diagnosis of allergic asthma. Similarly, the nasal challenge with lysine acetylsalicylate (L-ASA) can be used to identify aspirin-sensitive asthma patients.

If these episodes are mild and infrequent, asthma does not usually persist into the school years. However, if they are more frequent and severe, the asthma is likely to persist. After infancy, incidence falls and continues at about 100/100,000 for the rest of the lifespan. Allergic asthma develops most often in the second decade of life and frequently persists into adult years, but young patients with allergic asthma often enjoy a transient or even a permanent remission. More severe disease and continued allergen exposure cause persistence. Some patients with occupational asthma continue to have asthma long after exposure ceases. Asthma beginning after the fourth decade is usually intrinsic and may include the aspirin triad. Its severity tends to increase with time. Many middle-aged and elderly adults have a persistent decline in lung function that is retarded but not completely prevented by aerosol glucocorticoids. This loss of lung function is often the result of coexisting lung diseases, particularly bronchiectasis and COPD.

This review addresses their findings in the context of recent literature, and assesses the usefulness of these definitions in children in particular. RECENT FINDINGS: Severe asthma was defined by the level of current clinical control and risks as: 'Uncontrolled asthma which can result in risk of frequent severe exacerbations (or death) and/or adverse reactions to medications and/or chronic morbidity (including impaired lung function or reduced lung growth in children)'. Severe asthma includes three groups, with different public health messages and challenges: untreated severe asthma, due to undiagnosed asthma or unavailability of therapy, difficult-to-treat severe asthma (due to adherence issues, inappropriate or incorrect use of medicines, environmental triggers or co-morbidity), and treatment-resistant severe asthma, including asthma for which control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment or asthma which is controlled only with the highest level of recommended treatment. SUMMARY: These definitions will enable more precise measurement of the burden of severe childhood asthma globally. International collaborations in epidemiological and mechanistic studies, and randomized controlled trials of treatment, will be facilitated. However, both pathophysiology and severity are influenced by a number of factors with wide global variation; international comparisons should be interpreted with caution.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1097/ACI.0b013e32834487ae [doi],NLM,14736322

The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in identification of risk factors, pathophysiology and management of acute severe asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Although the exact mechanism for acute severe asthma is unclear, some that are implicated include inflammation, airway remodeling and downregulation of beta-receptors. None of the environmental factors have been clearly related to the development of near fatal attacks. Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with severe asthma. Lack of steroid responsiveness has been linked to severe asthma attacks. Chemokines and basement membrane changes characteristic of severe asthma are reported in a few studies. Lack of symptom perception in a certain group of patients with acute severe asthma leads to delayed interventions. Specific treatment modalities and ventilator management is reviewed.

Asthma is common in the elderly (age over 65 years) and can be more severe with little chance for remission. Asthma in older individuals is often under-diagnosed, misdiagnosed and frequently under-treated. Concomitant medical and psychosocial conditions are more prevalent in the elderly and can obfuscate the presentation of asthma and make it more difficult to assess and manage. While these comorbidities are important in understanding elderly asthma, aging itself can be considered a ""comorbidity"" since it impacts structural and functional changes in the lung. Structural changes of the aging lung may worsen physiologic function in asthma. The immune system also changes with age, with increased vulnerability to pathogens and differences in airway inflammation, leading to variability in how asthma manifests and responds to treatment. The fact that aging can influence the severity and presentation of asthma along with its diagnosis and management is important for the treating physician to understand.

However, there has been limited attention paid to the presence and potential impact of systemic inflammation in asthma. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological observations and cohort studies points to a host of downstream organ dysfunction in asthma especially among patients with longstanding or more severe disease, frequent exacerbations, and underlying risk factors for organ dysfunction. Most studies to date have focused on cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular abnormalities. In this review, we summarize some of the evidence demonstrating these abnormalities and highlight the proposed mechanisms and potential benefits of treatment in limiting these extrapulmonary abnormalities in patients with asthma.

As increasing numbers of new chemicals are produced and new manufacturing processes are introduced, the variety of environments in which individuals may become exposed to respiratory sensitizers and irritants makes diagnosing and treating this illness even more challenging. In addition to adverse pulmonary effects, the diagnosis of occupational asthma may bring with it negative social and financial implications that may ultimately affect the patient's quality of life. For this reason, it is important for clinicians to recognize work-related respiratory symptoms early on in their course, maintain a high clinical suspicion for an occupational cause in the diagnostic work-up of asthma, and have a high degree of certainty in the diagnosis. While a number of classification schemes have been proposed to simplify the diagnostic approach to occupational asthma, the inciting factors typically involve sensitization (often by an IgE mechanism), direct airway inflammation, various pharmacologic responses, or irritant reflex pathways. Clinicians must first document the presence of asthma, then establish a relationship between asthma and the work-place. The occupational history is the key diagnostic tool, and clinical suspicions may be evaluated further by serial peak expiratory flow measurements, nonspecific hypersensitivity challenges with histamine or methacholine, collaboration with industrial/occupational hygienists to obtain workplace exposure measurements, and specific challenge testing at tertiary referral centers providing specialized laboratories. Removal from the inciting exposure is the mainstay of therapy, and pharmacologic treatment of patients with occupational asthma is similar to the treatment of patients with other forms of asthma.",Journal Article||Review,62.0,S0025-6196(11)62415-4 [pii]||10.4065/76.6.633 [doi],NLM,00256196

The relationship between cigarette smoking and airway inflammation is also well described, but relatively little data are available on the potential influence of smoking on asthmatic airway inflammation and its treatment. While cigarette smoking is common in people with asthma, with prevalence rates similar to the general population, studies in asthma have tended to concentrate on individuals who have never smoked. However, there is recent evidence that smoking may confer a degree of corticosteroid resistance in asthma, and this review examines the relationship between asthma and cigarette smoking, with particular reference to the impact of smoking on the response to treatment of asthma. Smoking has a number of known influences on drug activity and metabolism, but the mechanism underlying corticosteroid resistance in asthmatic smokers is not yet clear, although there are differences in the nature of the airway inflammation in individuals with asthma who smoke compared with nonsmoking asthmatic patients. Encouragingly, there is some evidence that smoking cessation may at least partially restore corticosteroid responsiveness in asthmatic ex-smokers. Smoking cessation measures must be given a high priority in individuals with asthma who smoke.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",149.0,65115 [pii]||10.2165/00003495-200565110-00005 [doi],NLM,00126667

In industrialized countries, occupational factors have been implicated in 9 to 15% of all cases of adult asthma. Work-related asthma includes (1) immunologic occupational asthma (OA), characterized by a latency period before the onset of symptoms; (2) nonimmunologic OA, which occurs after single or multiple exposures to high concentrations of irritant materials; (3) work-aggravated asthma, which is preexisting or concurrent asthma exacerbated by workplace exposures; and (4) variant syndromes. Assessment of the work environment has improved, making it possible to measure concentrations of several high- and low-molecular-weight agents in the workplace. The identification of host factors, polymorphisms, and candidate genes associated with OA is in progress and may improve our understanding of mechanisms involved in OA. A reliable diagnosis of OA should be confirmed by objective testing early after its onset. Removal of the worker from exposure to the causal agent and treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids lead to a better outcome. Finally, strategies for preventing OA should be implemented and their cost-effectiveness examined.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",443.0,200311-1575SO [pii]||10.1164/rccm.200311-1575SO [doi],NLM,1073449X

The challenges in management of patients with asthma however are the recognition of the severity of the attack as well as an appreciation of sociobiological factors important in disease management.

Socio-biological factors include the contributions of race, ethnicity, and income and environmental triggers to disease severity and prevalence. Other challenges in asthma management include measurement of airway inflammation, challenges in the delivery of and recognition when emergency care fails, tailoring follow-up treatment, and standardization of hospital care. Intensive care management of asthma is not well standardized and relies on personal preferences and therapies that have not been well studied in children.

There is no clear evidence of a link between asthma and traffic fumes and air pollution. The vast majority of people with asthma take inhaled steroids, and these produce little or no side-effects. Tablet forms of the drug also have few side-effects if used for short courses of a few days. Only a minority need to take steroid tablets regularly, and need to discuss the issue of side-effects versus improvements in symptoms with their doctor. Most children use a preventer and a reliever medication. It is important that parents and child understand how and when to use each.

The priority areas identified for research in asthma include: (1) innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and tolerance; (2) mechanisms and consequences of persistent asthma and asthma exacerbations; (3) airway remodeling: clinical consequences and reversibility (clinical relevance and resolution); (4) genetics/gene-environment interactions, pharmacogenetics; (5) intervention/prevention/therapeutics; and (6) vascular basis of asthma.","Consensus Development Conference||Consensus Development Conference, NIH||Journal Article||Review",53.0,200311-1539WS [pii]||10.1164/rccm.200311-1539WS [doi],NLM,1073449X

Small airways, however, comprise a substantial component of the conducting lung air flow. In asthma, inflammatory processes can affect the whole respiratory tract, from central to peripheral/small airways. The emphasis in adult and pediatric respiratory disease clinics is to focus on large airway obstruction and reversibility. This information, although valuable, underemphasizes a large portion of the conduction airway of asthmatics. Standard descriptions of asthma management focus on a multiple medication approaches. We particularly focused on the management of asthma in the international guidelines for the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Overall, however, minimal attention is placed on the small airway pool in asthma medical management. We took the opportunity to thoroughly review and present specific data from the adult asthma literature which supported the concept that small airway abnormalities may play a role in the pathogenesis and clinical expression of asthma. Based on the conclusions of the adult asthma literature, we here present a thorough review of the literature as it relates to small airway disease in children with asthma. We used, collectively, individual data sources of data to expand the information available from standard diagnostic techniques, especially spirometry, in the evaluation of small airway disease. As the pharmacological approaches to moderate to severe asthma are advancing rapidly into the realm of biologics, we sought to present potential pharmacological options for small airway dysfunction in pediatrics prior to biological modifier intervention.",Journal Article||Review,,10.1007/s12016-020-08818-1 [pii]||10.1007/s12016-020-08818-1 [doi],NLM,15590267

Airway inflammation, smooth-muscle contraction, epithelial sloughing, mucous hypersecretion, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucosal edema contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of asthma. Diagnostic tests such as methacholine or mannitol challenges or spirometry (pre- and postbronchodilator responses) help to identify such underlying pathophysiology via assessments of bronchial hyperreactivity and lung mechanics but are imperfect and, ultimately, must be viewed in the context of a patient's clinical presentation, including response to pharmacotherapy. Asthma can be classified into either intermittent or persistent, and the latter is either mild, moderate, or severe. Some patients change, in either direction, from intermittent to persistent asthma. In addition, patients with asthma may be classified as allergic (immunoglobulin E mediated), nonallergic (often triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections or no apparent cause), occupational, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, potentially fatal, exercise-induced, and cough variant asthma. In the latter, the patients have a nonproductive cough that responds to treatment for asthma but not with antibiotics, expectorants, mucolytics, antitussives, or beta(2)-adrenergic agonists, and to treatment for acid reflux and rhinosinusitis. Thus, cough variant asthma is in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't||Review",,10.2500/aap.2019.40.4253 [doi],NLM,15396304

Of 3,015 patients who regarded their asthma as mild, 26 percent reported awakening every night, suggesting that many patients underestimate the severity of their asthma. Patients with no nocturnal asthma generally had a lower frequency of allergic and nonallergic trigger factors, but no dominant feature distinguished these patients from those who did awaken at night. As perceived asthma severity increased, so did the number of drug types being prescribed, but no particular drug was identified as being associated with a lower frequency of nocturnal asthma. The frequency of nocturnal asthma found in the survey population (74 percent), in which 48 percent of the patients were using corticosteroid aerosols, was identical to that found in a survey conducted in 1971, when this medication was not yet available. Even though the sampling methods used in the two surveys were different, this finding indicates that the introduction of aerosol steroids has had little effect on the frequency of nocturnal asthma.

DATA SOURCES: This article is based on a presentation given by the author at a symposium entitled. New Frontiers in Asthma Management: Biotechnology for Optimal Therapeutic and Economic Outcomes. at the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy's 15th Annual Meeting and Showcase in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on April 10, 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, various other cell mediators and cytokines, and immunoglobulin E play important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. Atopy is an inherited condition characterized by a predominance of Th2 cells and it predisposes to asthma. Objective measures of pulmonary function improve confidence in the diagnosis of asthma and should be used to monitor response to therapy. Asthma severity is often underestimated by patients and physicians, which can lead to inadequate treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the preferred maintenance treatment for patients with persistent asthma because these medications are the most potent and effective long-term controller pharmaceutical agents. Addition of a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist or a leukotriene modifier to ICS therapy provides added benefit to patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma inadequately controlled by corticosteroids. Choosing an appropriate delivery system for inhaled drug therapies can affect patient adherence and the effectiveness of therapy.",Journal Article||Review,,2003(9)5: 8-13 [pii]||10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.s5.8 [doi],NLM,10834087

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A South Australian population-representative study of 3175 adults who provided data on asthma, psychological morbidity, physical functioning, and body mass index. Bivariate and multivariate analyses identified how these comorbidities were distributed in asthma and non-asthma subpopulations, and the variance in physical functioning that they explained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of obesity and psychological morbidity, and physical functioning scores in asthma and non-asthma populations. RESULTS: Men and women in the asthma population had similar prevalences of obesity (35.3% v 33.6%) and psychological morbidity (29.5% v 29.4%). When compared with non-asthma controls, both comorbidities were significantly higher only in men with asthma. The prevalence of psychological morbidity within different weight categories in the asthma population compared with non-asthma weight-category controls varied by sex. Physical functioning was lower in the asthma population than the non-asthma population (46.6 [95% CI, 45.9-47.3] v 48.8 [95% CI, 47.8-50.0]; P < 0.001), and psychological morbidity explained 22% of this variance. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological morbidity and obesity are common in people with asthma. The sex-specific variation in psychological morbidity across weight categories suggests that future studies of psychological morbidity in groups with asthma should adopt designs that consider sex-specific controls rather than comparisons between the sexes.","Journal Article||Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,wil11467_fm [pii]||10.5694/j.1326-5377.2010.tb03559.x [doi],NLM,0025729X
